# The Rapport

What the printed Einsatzrapport carries (`src/lib/report.ts`, `src/lib/reportPdfDirect.ts`,
`src/lib/auswertung.ts`, `backend/app/report`, `backend/app/kroki.py`). Moved here from AGENTS.md on 2026-10-08,
wording unchanged.

## Offline attachments

Rapport-Beilagen store their prepared photo bytes in the incident's media queue before the
first upload (`useRowMediaUpload`, `mediaQueue · target: 'attachment'`). They contribute to the
shared pending/error/storage status and retry on reconnect. After a reload, the queue restores
a fresh session URL on the existing attachment; after upload it replaces only that row's URL,
keeping its caption. A deleted attachment is never recreated by a late upload or restore. Undo
snapshots learn the uploaded URL too, so undo/redo cannot put back an expired session URL after
the queue has acknowledged its bytes. A queue entry without a target remains journal media.

## Abschluss – the «Noch offen» sheet (23.10.2026)

`useAbschluss · confirmAndComplete` asks the one closing question over `lib/abschluss`'s
Mindestangaben (`abschlussOpenItems`). **Every row is a link to its field, and only that** (owner,
11.11.2026: «drop the quick action buttons. just open the position»): the one-tap answers the 3am
sweep had put on the rows («Jetzt setzen», «Nichts verwendet», «Entfällt», «Wählen», «Schreiben»)
are gone from all three lists – this sheet, the print's «Angaben fehlen noch» and the Kontrolle
chip's popover. The fast tap was often the wrong answer («Entfällt» for a Rückmeldung ELZ that was
given). An empty **Einsatzende is pre-filled with «jetzt»** on the deployment clock
(`serverNowIso`), shown as a done row in the step's own place on the list (a tap changes it); the
close writes it before the handover, so «Einsatzende» (the step `zeiten`) is only open on a sheet
that may not write the Rapport. The success toast says «Einsatz abgeschlossen» and carries «Wieder
öffnen» for 10 s (docs/undo.md). Close and reopen stamps come off `lib/serverClock`, like the
Rapport's own «Jetzt» buttons.

**The crews question comes first, once** (`useAbschluss`): a Notfall, then Trupps still inside,
then Trupps still angemeldet. «Zur Tafel» is the focused answer only for a closer who can write the
Tafel; the `el` role gets «Trotzdem abschliessen» / «Abbrechen» («Abbrechen» focused) and the line
«Austragen kann nur, wer die Atemschutz-Tafel führt.» (sweep R2, 11.11.2026). Answered «trotzdem»,
the Trupps are not listed again on the sheet after it.

**The print's «Angaben fehlen noch» is the same list (31.10.2026)**: both confirms take rows and
order from ONE builder (`lib/abschlussOpen · abschlussSheet`); only the words around the list are
each one's own. The print lists the Mindestangaben only – a Trupp still out and the pending uploads
are closing questions – and pre-fills nothing.

The Einsatzdaten card has no pencil (31.10.2026): the card is the pointer's target, its heading
«Aus den Einsatzdaten» the keyboard's (a `role="button"` span – a `<button>` would be disabled
with the Rapport's fieldset while the Einsatzdaten may still be edited).

## The strip under the head – the guide and the band (28.10.2026), the close in the head (11.11.2026)

Owner picks 14 «top strip» and 15B (`ReportPreflight · RpStrip`, one size for both, outside the
scrolling body so it stays visible with the keyboard up):

- **The open points are in page order** (`lib/abschluss · ABSCHLUSS_STEPS`): Kurzbericht ·
  Einsatzleiter · Kontaktperson · Einsatzende · Rückmeldung ELZ, then Anwesenheit · Material ·
  Abweichungen – the «n offen» list, the confirms and the guide all read that order. The step
  `zeiten` is labelled «Einsatzende», the field that is actually missing.
- **The guide**: a jump from the «n offen» list (or the «Angaben fehlen noch» confirm) leaves a
  strip «Nächster offener Punkt · noch N offen / <Punkt>»; a tap is the same jump to it
  (`nextOpenStep`: the next open one down the page, wrapping, never the current one). «Letzter
  offener Punkt» when only that one is left; at the last open point the strip is gone. ✕ puts it
  away until the next jump from the list. It never becomes the PDF button.
- **The band, one step earlier**: as soon as nothing is open and no PDF exists, the green strip
  says «Alles erfasst · Nächster Schritt / Einsatzrapport (PDF) erstellen» (no «Später» – it goes
  away by itself).
- **The close is the head's** (owner picks H1 A + H2 C, 11.11.2026): the head row is «Ausdrucken ·
  PDF ▾» (folded on a phone: «Drucken · PDF ▾», both with a word). Once nothing is open AND a
  rapport exists – a PDF, or a print the relay reported done (both stamp `reportMadeAt`) – the head
  grows a green «Einsatz abschliessen» in the place the «n offen» chip stood (beside the title; on a
  phone the two halves keep the row under it). It
  replaced the «Rapport erstellt · Nächster Schritt» strip and the grey «Abschliessen» tile that led
  the row from the first second (active at «4 offen», the irreversible step first – sweep R9).
  Before that moment the close is the Einsatz ▾ menu's. The ZIP of the Beilagen is in the PDF ▾ menu.
- **Closed: one strip, the state** (owner, 12.11.2026: «either closed or the next step»). A closed
  Einsatz shows the amber «Einsatz abgeschlossen – zum Bearbeiten wieder öffnen» with «Wieder
  öffnen» beside it (the Einsatz card's action and confirm; «… – nur ansehen» without the button
  for a session that cannot reopen). Nothing asks for a signature: closed means done, and signing
  is the optional card below. The closing device lands on the launcher anyway – the strip is what
  «Alle Einsätze» → a closed Einsatz shows. A print still out keeps its own amber band.

## Times – one control, date + time everywhere (12.11.2026)

Owner pick A «Ein Feld» (`components/TimeField · DateTimeField`, header there):

- **Every time of the Rapport is date + time**, on tablet, phone and the QR-Erfassung alike: the
  Zeiten grid (Alarmierung Gruppen, Ausrückzeiten der Fahrzeuge), Ausgerückt, Einsatzende,
  Rückmeldung ELZ, the Anwesenheit's von / bis (`TimeBlockSheet` – the Zeitplan's shift sheet
  shares it) and the Einsatz wizard's Alarmzeit. **No day is guessed**: the picker always shows
  its day column, and what «OK» commits is what it showed (the old clock-only grid rolled a bare
  «00:15» past midnight after the commit – `zeitFromClock`, gone). An empty grid row opens on the
  alarm, every other empty field on «now». Stored values stay ISO (UTC); the form holds ISO too.
- **The read-out is «12.11. 11:26»** – the day quiet, the clock loud; the year only when it is not
  the Einsatz's year («31.12.2025 23:50»), empty «--.--. --:--» (`format · fieldWhen`). The same on
  every read-only rendering (viewer, closed or signed Rapport) and the derived «Ausgerückt». One
  exception: the «Alarmierung» line of the Einsatzdaten block keeps the full date
  («20.09.2026 14:05») – it is the Einsatz's own date, so the year rule would never show its year. A
  vehicle's grey «vor Ort / zurück» line is a server read-out, not a field: a bare clock, with its
  day only when that is not the row's. **The PDF keeps its own formats** (`report · formatDateTime`).
- **«Jetzt» is the deployment's clock** (`lib/serverClock`), on the two form buttons (Einsatzende,
  Rückmeldung ELZ – tablet, phone and QR-Erfassung) and inside every picker. Grid rows have no form
  button. The QR-Erfassung learns the clock from its own answers (`captureClient · req`).
- **The QR-Erfassung behaves like the tablet** for the same field: one control, and «Leeren» clears
  an Einsatzende or a Rückmeldung there too (a null commit used to be ignored).

## Unterschriften – signing on the screen (15.10.2026)

The two Visum lines (Einsatzleiter, Kommandant) can be signed with a finger instead of a pen.
**Optional**, never asked for: the «Unterschriften» card in the right-hand column, after the
Partnerorganisationen (the paper's order; on a phone in «Personal & Mittel»). Owner decisions and
the three mockup rounds: `docs/planning/signature-2026-10-15/` (local, gitignored).

- **What is signed** is the signed part of the paper form – Haupt-Rapport + Personal + Material –
  as SHA-256 over a canonical JSON of the SAME payload the PDF is composed from, with every
  Beilage left out (`reportPdfDirect · signedPartOf`, `reportSignature · signatureScope`). The
  Journal is a Beilage: a late Funk row is a Nachtrag and does not touch a signature. Times,
  Personal, Material, Kurzbericht, Einsatzleiter … do.
- **Only on a closed Einsatz**, and a signature counts only if it was made after the LATEST close
  (`last_closed_at`): «Wieder öffnen» ends every signature without anybody voiding it.
- **Closed = locked, signed or not** (owner, 12.11.2026). The form of a closed Einsatz is
  read-only (`workspace/access · canEditRapport` is the running record's); what the keeper of the
  Rapport still writes is the signing and what goes with it (`canSignRapport`: the signature, the
  Einsatzleiter it names, «Rapport erstellt», a print job). The way to a correction is «Wieder
  öffnen», which ends every signature. The «Ändern» that voided them by hand is gone with that;
  voided ones from before stay in `Saved.reportSignatures` with `voidedAt`/`voidReason` and in the
  Verlauf.
- **The server never refuses a save to keep a signature valid.** An offline tablet's Anwesenheit
  must still arrive. Validity is COMPUTED on every device (hash of now vs hash at signing); a
  signature that no longer holds shows «ungültig ›» and a tap signs anew.
- **Who signs**: name + drawn strokes, the same trust as a pen (the login is a shared station
  account). The Einsatzleiter's name IS the Rapport's Einsatzleiter (written back when signing);
  the Kommandant's defaults to `identity.kommandant`, and a deputy picks themselves.
- **Stored**: the SHAPE of the strokes only (integers in a 1000-wide box) – no timing, no pressure
  (PRIVACY.md). Each signing writes a Verlauf row («Rapport unterschrieben: …, Prüfsumme …») and a
  hash-chained audit event (`report.signature.add` / `.void`).
- **On paper** (`app/report · _draw_signature`): the strokes sit on the line beside the name,
  «Ort, Datum» is filled in (`map.geocoder.defaultLocality` without its postcode), and a small line
  says «Am Bildschirm unterschrieben … · Prüfsumme …». A signature that no longer holds is not
  sent; its line prints empty. **Decision E stands**: the printed paper is the record – the
  strokes are only how its signature got onto it. No PDF is stored, no PDF seal. (One exception,
  off by default: while the Einsatz-Ablage is on, the server keeps the newest composed Rapport-PDF
  of each Einsatz to file it – [`incident-archive.md`](incident-archive.md).)
- **Legal standing (19.10.2026)**: a *simple* electronic signature – not an advanced or qualified
  one under ZertES (SR 943.03), so it does not satisfy a statutory written form (OR Art. 14). Of
  the advanced signature's four criteria it misses «sole control» and «uniquely linked to the
  signer» (shared login, no key), and the Prüfsumme detects a change only inside the app (no key,
  no outside timestamp). Hence «Am Bildschirm», never «digital», on the paper. A recipient who
  needs the written form gets a printout signed by hand.

## The Einsatzjournal on paper

- **Zeit and Bereich are as wide as their widest label** (`app/report` · journal `col_w`, capped at
  29 / 38 mm): ReportLab breaks a word that does not fit its cell, and the fixed 24 mm Bereich
  printed «Sofortmassna / hme» on every such row (23.10.2026).
- **A one-day Einsatz prints the time alone** («07:03»); the date stands once in the heading,
  «Einsatzjournal · 23.10.2026» (`reportPdfDirect · oneDay` → `ReportPayload.journalDay`). Rows
  across midnight keep «Datum Zeit» on every row.

## Messungen (10.11.2026)

A Messpunkt's gas readings print as their own section (owner pick 1B), a Beilage after the
Einsatzjournal and the Pendenzen (`lib/readingLog · readingsForReport` → `ReportPayload.messungen`
→ `app/report/messungen`):

- **One block per Messpunkt**: a head row – room, Geschoss («UG»), how often it was measured, and
  at the right edge the LAST reading («zuletzt 19:04 · CO 0 ppm», with its Stufe when it has one) –
  then the history, oldest first, the newest row bold. One row per radio report (the panel's
  `readingRows` fold); it leads with the gas the map's pill wore for those values (`worstGas`), the
  other gases beside the Stufe. Points worst first by their last reading (`compareReadings`).
- **The Stufe is a word** – «A1 Voralarm», «A2 Hauptalarm», «über Messbereich (A2 Hauptalarm)»,
  «unlesbar». The square before it and the colour only repeat it: a monochrome print says the
  same. Worded by the composer (`labels.py`), the client sends the state.
- **The limits print once above the table** («Grenzwerte dieses Einsatzes: …», `readingLimitsText`):
  they are the station's setting, and the paper outlives it.
- **No switch.** The section prints whenever a point has a reading and is absent otherwise – heading
  included. It is not part of the signed scope (`reportSignature · NOT_SIGNED`).
- ⚠️ **The Journal carries none of the reading rows** (owner: «in the verlauf everything but in the
  pdf just in the separate table»): `report · journalRows` drops a reading row and the ↶ / ↷ of one
  (`readingLog · isReadingRow` – by the row's icon, never by its words: «Messung im Keller
  angeordnet» is somebody's entry and prints).
- «O₂» / «H₂S» print through `<sub>` (`messungen · _gas`): Helvetica has no subscript digits.

## What the figure pages carry

- **What the Rapport's figure pages carry (18.09.2026).** The **Kroki is the picture**; everything
  else is opt-in or earns its page. Four rules, each from a printed review:
  - **Objektpläne are OFF by default** (`report · defaultReportOptions.annotatedPlans`). A linked
    sheet counts as «annotated» the moment the Karte's objects project onto it, so «on when there
    are any» stapled every linked plan to every rapport. They are reference material the station already owns.
  - **The Gebäude is its own section** (`options.gebaeude`, on), not one of the «Pläne»: it
    carries the Einsatz's own work. Only storeys with content print
    (`reportPdfDirect · usedStackFloors`); an untouched stack prints no page.
  - **A legend line says what the thing IS** – «Art · Bezeichnung · Status»
    (`symbols · symbolLegendText`), for every symbol. ⚠️ Not `symbolCaptionText`: the screen's
    value-only caption is an answer without its question once lifted into a legend. A symbol's own
    `caption: 'off'` is a screen declutter and is not read; only «Beschriftungen aus» silences it.
    A «Gelöscht / erledigt» symbol ends its line on that Status with its time («Feuer · gelöscht
    20:40», 24.09.2026) and prints grey, never absent. A vehicle's Herkunft is keyed – «Fahrzeug ·
    TLF · Meier · Herkunft: Stützpunkt» (05.11.2026) – because a bare «Stützpunkt» beside a name
    reads as a place; a live GPS vehicle prints its name and the same «Herkunft: …». The Erste
    Führung «Mittel» table seeds a placed vehicle as «TLF (Stützpunkt)» (`boardSeed`).
  - **One figure-page template** (`app/report · figure_pages`): heading, then the muted «Einsatz ·
    Stand …» line, picture, legend – for the Kroki, a plan sheet and a Gebäude page alike. A new
    kind of figure page joins that list; it does not get a layout block of its own. Orientation is
    per kind ON PURPOSE: the Kroki is a free crop (the operator's choice), a plan sheet has the
    shape its author gave it (the bitmap decides).
  - **A sheet the renderer throws on keeps its place** (23.10.2026): heading plus «Seite «…»
    konnte nicht gedruckt werden.», logged at ERROR. It used to be skipped with a warning – and
    from 22.07. to 23.10.2026 that silently dropped every Tafel-Skizze with a Linie or Fläche,
    because plan points are `[x, y, floor]` and `kroki · _overlay_board_annos` unpacked two. The
    renderer reads `p[0], p[1]`; the client sends the points as stored.
  - **An attached Leitung end is coupled by the SERVER** (`kroki · _snap_attached_ends`, fed by
    `startAt` / `endAt` + the entity `id`; a branch off a Teilstück by `startAtLine` / `endAtLine`
    onto the fork's prong tip – `_snap_line_joints`, one geometry with the glyph: `_fork_dims`). The client has no projection and ends the line on a
    fixed ground footprint; the glyph is sized in pixels, so only the sheet's own view can land the
    end on it. ⚠️ And the fallback fit mirrors the PANEL: the ceiling is
    `report · krokiFitMaxZoom` (20; 21 for a COMPACT Lage under 30 m – one level past the basemap's
    last sharp one, so a single-building cluster is not 15 % of the sheet). That is a MapLibre
    camera zoom, one level tighter than the 256-px projection: `app/report · _kroki_fit_max_z` = +1.
    On paper the count badge is a WHITE chip like the storey badge – the numbered legend discs are
    the only dark marks on the sheet.

## The Auswertung sheet (09.10.2026, F7)

- **A debrief lives on paper, not on a screen** (owner: «maybe just on the pdf export?»). The
  optional «Auswertung» is the LAST sheet of the Rapport, landscape: key figures, swimlanes, and a
  pointer «Lehren / Sicherheit: siehe Seite 1» – the Lehren themselves print once, on page 1 with
  the signed record. It is internal – the signed part above it is what leaves the station, so it is the sheet
  that comes off the stack. `ReportOptions.auswertung` is **off by default** (owner, 10.10.2026 – it
  was seeded «ticked when a crew went in under Atemschutz» on 2026-10-09): the operator ticks
  «Auswertung (intern)» in the PDF ▾ menu, and that pick is kept for the Einsatz. It is OFF for the
  QR-Erfassung's own PDF too; a viewer link cannot make a PDF at all.
- **Derived on the client, printed by the server.** `lib/auswertung` reads the record where the
  ISO stamps are and sends minute offsets + finished strings in the deployment's language
  (`app/report · AuswertungIn`) – the same split as `personalSummary`. Nothing is estimated: a
  figure without its data prints «—», a vehicle that never reported vor Ort gets a dot, not a bar.
- **«Funkkontakte eingehalten» is the board's own rule.** An interval runs from the Eintritt or a
  contact (Kontakt, Druck, Alarm, Rückzug, Wiedereinstieg) to the next one or the Austritt;
  fällig past the interval, überfällig past interval + grace (`atemschutz · contactSeverity`). An
  interval still open counts only once it was already overdue. Watched = under PA, read per run
  off `paOn`/`paOff`. ⚠️ The clock also restarts at a REOPEN with no reading in the log
  (`reopenClocks · closedPauses`): the closed stretch is cut out, or it reads as an overrun. A
  Trupp taken off the Tafel ends at its `removedAt`; one that never went in is not drawn.
- **The axis is clamped** to alarm − 2 h … Einsatzende (or now) + 2 h, at most a week: one
  mistyped date must not squeeze the whole picture into a hairline. The figures still read the
  record as it is.
- **Greyscale first.** Most station printers are mono: fällig carries a sparse hatch, überfällig a
  dense cross-hatch on top of their amber/red, and the chart is canvas strokes (never a bitmap).
  Milestones are numbered diamonds with the words in a list underneath – the Kroki's rule, numbers
  on the picture and words in the legend.
