# KP Front — make a Railway staging environment a copy of production again.
#
#   ./scripts/railway-staging-refresh.sh              # production → staging, asks first
#   ./scripts/railway-staging-refresh.sh --yes        # no question (for a scheduled refresh)
#   ./scripts/railway-staging-refresh.sh --db-only    # skip the storage volume (fast)
#
# Staging is a second Railway ENVIRONMENT of the same project (`railway environment new staging
# --duplicate production`), deployed from the `staging` branch, with its own Postgres, its own
# volume and its own URL — so an installed staging PWA is a separate app from the prod one.
# This script copies prod's database and storage volume into it and then CUTS every path by
# which a copy of prod reaches real people. Everything in staging is overwritten; test data
# made there is gone afterwards.
#
# Production is only READ: `pg_dump` and `tar -c` over `railway ssh`, nothing else. The local
# key must be registered once (`railway ssh keys add`).
#
# ⚠️ What a verbatim copy of prod would do, and what this script does about it:
#   · push_subscriptions are prod's real devices — staging would send them «Neuer Einsatz» on
#     every Divera alarm it polls. → emptied; staging has its own VAPID pair in its variables.
#   · alarms.webhooks would fire a second time per alarm. → emptied.
#   · healthcheck_ping_url would keep prod's dead-man's switch green while prod is down. →
#     stored credential deleted; the variable must be empty in staging too.
#   · print_agent_secret / the two inbound webhook secrets are prod's. → stored copies
#     deleted; staging's variables carry its own values.
#   · identity.appName becomes «KP Staging», so the installed app and every head say which
#     one this is.
# The restore and those cuts are ONE transaction: the app sees the empty database or the cut
# copy, never prod's push targets. Read-only feeds (Divera poll, Traccar, SharePoint, STT,
# CARTO) are deliberately kept – staging sees the same alarms and vehicles as prod.
#
# ⚠️ SECRET_KEY must be the same in both environments (the duplicate copies it): it peppers
# every PIN and seals the stored credentials. A different key = nobody can log in to staging.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # single-quoted commands expand $DATABASE_URL on the remote side
