# --- Stage 1: build the SPA ---------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned to the BUILD platform, not the target: the output is plain JS/CSS and works on any
# architecture, so pinning keeps the Vite build native even when the final image is arm64 —
# otherwise a multi-arch build runs pnpm under QEMU and takes an order of magnitude longer.
# Node 24 = Active LTS (security support to 2028-04-30). Node 20 went end-of-life on
# 2026-04-30 and this stage sat on it for three months. Keep in step with node-version in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml and the engines field in package.json; dependabot's docker
# ecosystem now proposes the bumps so it cannot drift silently again.
# Named on Docker Hub, which Dependabot reads (through ECR Public it was answered with 429s).
# CI's BuildKit resolves docker.io through mirror.gcr.io instead (.github/actions/stack).

# pg_dump for the pre-migration safety dump in start.sh (and manual in-container dumps).
# It comes from PGDG, not from Debian: bookworm ships client 15, and pg_dump refuses to dump
# a server NEWER than itself. So every migration logged «pre-migration dump failed —
# continuing, but fix your backups» and then migrated with no backup at all — on CI and on
# every self-hosted box following SETUP.md.
#
# ⚠️ This must be >= the HIGHEST server major this image will ever be pointed at, not just
# the one in docker-compose.yml. Pinning it to the compose image (16) is what broke it the
# second time: compose runs postgres:16, but Railway production runs 18.x, so a client that
# matched compose still could not dump production — and start.sh's guard skipped the dump
# silently on every deploy. A newer client dumps an older server fine, never the reverse,
# so one pin at the highest server covers every deployment target:
#     Railway production 18.x  ─┐
#     docker-compose  16       ─┴─> postgresql-client-18
# Verify with `SHOW server_version` against each target before lowering this.
