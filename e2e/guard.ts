// ── The client-error guard (24.09.2026) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every spec imports `test` from ./helpers (which re-exports this one), never from
// '@playwright/test' — eslint enforces it — and so every spec fails when the app reports a
// client error or a render storm, even if everything it asserts still holds. On 23.09.2026 the
// Karte of every device sat in a render loop for hours, and the only witness was
// `POST /api/diag/client-error` (lib/reportError, fed by the ErrorBoundary, the window handlers,
// MapView's map errors and lib/useRenderStorm): it lands in the server log and never failed a
// build. Now it fails the test that caused it, with the payload attached.
//
// Two signals, because either can be the one that got out: the report request itself (every
// kind — render, error, unhandledrejection, surface-recrash, render-storm), and the console /
// uncaught-error line of the loop itself (React #185, «Maximum update depth exceeded»), which
// is there even when the report is still waiting for lib/reportError's budget.
//
// A test that provokes a report ON PURPOSE names it, report by report, with
// `test.use({ expectedClientErrors: [/^error: Failed to fetch$/] })` — matched against
// «kind: message» of the report body. Nothing else is excused. A crash is never excused, whatever
// the list says: not the kinds render / surface-recrash / render-storm, and not the console /
// uncaught line of a render loop. There is deliberately no switch that turns the guard off.
//
// One thing is excused without asking (09.10.2026): a basemap tile that broke — see
// `TILE_BREAK`. A reload while the Karte is still fetching its tiles makes WebKit fail the
// in-flight tile fetches («Load failed») and the half-read tile blobs («…createImageBitmap»),
// and MapLibre hands both to MapView's error event — on CI, at random, in whichever smoke reloads
// on the Karte. Third-party tiles failing is not a client error of ours. The network events do
// not reliably show it: in the trace of one such failure, 15 «Load failed» reports came with 3
// `requestfailed` events for tiles, so the test is «tiles were loading then», not «a tile failed».
