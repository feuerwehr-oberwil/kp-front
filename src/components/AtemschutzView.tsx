// The Atemschutz board – the Trupps page of an Einsatz: the phone board (Drin · Sicherungstrupp ·
// Bereit · Draussen), the tablet grid, the handed-over link Tafel (`lite`) and the Trupp form
// (`TruppForm.tsx`). ONE card on every board (`TruppCard.tsx`: `RowLine` + `TruppPair`, the phone
// row grown downwards) – a board differs only in what it has room for, never in a card of its own.
// Every warning tier comes from `truppAlarm` (lib/atemschutz), the same number the tone uses; the
// alarm itself runs app-wide in `useAtemschutzAlarm`, so it fires while this page is not on screen.
// Rules for this area: docs/atemschutz-board.md.

                board. What keeps them apart is the card's own restraint — no tint, no clock, no

          the strip's own grid then simply draws no tabs. Generous bottom padding
