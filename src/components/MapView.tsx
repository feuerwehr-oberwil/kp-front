          The arrow tip sitting `EXTEND_STEP_PX` PAST each open end of a selected line, pointing the

          tapping the arrow — which is what an arrow tip invites — did nothing at all and the line
          just sat there. Now pointerdown appends one node AT the arrow, one fixed step further out,
          and hands the same press over to that node's drag: let go without moving and the line grew
          by one step; keep moving and it follows the finger. Exactly what the «+» does one segment
          back, and exactly what the Plan's grip already did (Whiteboard · extendLine) — the two
          surfaces now grow a line the same way.
          ⚠️ Offset OUTWARD, never on the endpoint itself: the endpoint already carries the node
          handle and, when attached, the detach chip. A grip on top of those would be a third
          thing competing for the same pixel.
