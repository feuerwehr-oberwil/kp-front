 *  ingest was retired (PRIVACY.md § «Where it goes») it has no destination to transmit TO —
 *  so the sheet no longer offers a «Senden» button that would queue a report into an outbox
 *  nobody drains. What it does instead is prepare a report properly and hand it to the
 *  operator: pick a route, and the sheet fills in the form or the mail and saves the
 *  Diagnose-Datei to attach.
 *
 *  That file is the point of the whole screen. Prose plus a build number says «es ist
 *  abgestürzt»; the Diagnose-Datei carries the station's own sanitised crash traces, which is
 *  the half that makes a bug findable. It is fetched when the sheet opens so the count can be
 *  shown honestly before anyone commits to anything — «3 Fehlerprotokolle» is a fact the
 *  operator can check, and an empty buffer says so rather than promising a file with nothing
 *  in it.
 *
 *  A photo, if one helps, is attached the same way the file is: in the mail or in the issue.
 *  The app used to downscale and base64 one into a telemetry payload, which only ever existed
 *  because that payload was the only transport out. It isn't any more. */
