// «Teilen» — every way this app hands an Einsatz to somebody, in one file.
//
// ONE SHEET, TWO TABS (03.09.)
// ----------------------------
// «Teilen» opens THIS surface directly, and the tab decides which link you get. There is no
// chooser step in front of it any more: a menu whose rows lead to a sheet that then shows the
// same choice again is one question asked twice.
//
// It used to be three links, and the top two said the same sentence — «der ganze Einsatz, nur
// lesen» — differing only in how long they lasted. So they are one link now, and it is the one
// that always works: the `view` link carries a secret of its own on the incident row, so it
// needs no station key AND it survives the Abschluss. (The alerting gateway's JWT still exists
// on the wire and in every alarm text — nothing mints one by hand any more; see lib/viewLink.)
//
// The two doors (see lib/viewLink · shareDoors):
//   · «Ganzer Einsatz – nur lesen» — Karte, Pläne, Verlauf, Fotos, Zeiten. For the Zentrale, den
//                                    EL or a Nachbarwehr mid-Einsatz, and for der Gemeinde or a
//                                    Nachbarwehr afterwards: it outlives the Abschluss.
//   · «Nur Atemschutz – bedienen»  — the Überwachungstafel of this one Einsatz on somebody
//                                    else's phone, and they operate it. Dies at the Abschluss.
//
// Where this surface is reached from, and why each is contextual rather than a link of its own:
//   · «Teilen» im Einsatzkopf and on der Einsatz-Karte — the plain way in, opens on the
//     read-only tab;
//   · the Rapport's «Weitergeben» section renders `ShareIncident` INLINE — it is this surface,
//     not a second door to it, and handing the finished Einsatzakte out belongs exactly there;
//   · the QR beside the Atemschutz bell lands straight on «Nur Atemschutz», because standing on
//     the Tafel deciding to hand it over, that is the only thing it could have meant.
//
// Everything below the tabs — QR, address, Senden, Aufheben — is the same block for both; only
// the sentences differ, because what the link hands over is the ONE thing somebody has to have
// read before sending it on.
//
// The QR is what makes the handover work at all. The realistic handover in an Einsatz is
// «Tablet hinhalten», not «Adresse kopieren» — and the code is drawn from the address as soon
// as there is one. Lazily: `qrcode` otherwise ships only in the admin chunk, and there is no
// reason for every field device to carry it. Its absence is never fatal — no QR still leaves
// the address, which is the part that always works.

/** ONE address, presented the one way this app presents an address to hand over: the QR that
 *  makes «Tablet hinhalten» work, the whole URL as the copy target, and the device's own Teilen
 *  sheet where that exists. `children` takes whatever else belongs on that row — both links put
