// the most consequential effect of a pan: a label whose disc leaves the frame drops off the
// sheet entirely. Preview-grade only in the glyphs; the server render stays the source of truth.
//
// A PANEL on the Rapport surface, not the modal it was until 2026-08-07. As a modal it opened

          gives it full brightness back under the hand. Everything that only helps with FRAMING —
          the hint line, Hoch/Quer, ±, «Auf Einsatz zoomen» — stays outside it. */}
