/**
 * ONE shared form for create / edit / re-deploy, in one of two shapes.
 *
 * ⚠️ The rule used to be «single screen, never a wizard» (3am tenet). It is now narrower than
 * that, because the screen it was written for is not the only one any more — but the WIZARD is
 * gone again (04.09.), and what replaced it is closer to the original rule than the two steps
 * ever were:
 *   · On anything with room — tablet, desktop — it is ONE screen. Nothing is behind a section,
 *     nothing has to be walked to, and the whole Trupp is visible while it is being formed.
 *   · On a PHONE it is a STACK of three sections (`stack`): Mannschaft · Luft & Funk · Auftrag &
 *     Leitung. All three are on screen at all times; exactly one is open and the other two read
 *     their own answers out beside their titles («Unter Atemschutz · 300 bar · Kanal 5»), so the
 *     closed stack IS the form rather than a table of contents for it. Sections can be opened in
 *     any order and closed again — three answered lines is a legitimate, and useful, state.
 *   · ⚠️ It was a two-STEP wizard from 02.09. to 04.09., and the reason it went is not that the
 *     fold it fixed came back — it did not. It is that the wizard grew its OWN fold: step 2
 *     carried seven fields (Art · Druck · Kanal · Auftrag · Ziel · Leitung · Farbe) and ran off
 *     the bottom of a 375px screen, while the common Trupp — GF + 2, full cylinder, default
 *     channel — still had to walk a «Weiter» that asked nothing it had not already answered. The
 *     stack has no step to walk and no fold to fall off: what does not fit scrolls, and the one
 *     control that starts the Trupp is pinned in the footer the whole time.
 *   · ⚠️ EVERY kind of Trupp gets the same three sections (03.09., and unchanged by the rework).
 *     The Art may add or drop the Druck row inside «Luft & Funk» — ordinary form behaviour — but
 *     it must never change the SHAPE of the form. Collapsing to one screen under the thumb that
 *     had just tapped «Ohne Atemschutz» was the jarring part, not the length of a step.
 *   · ⚠️ «Art des Trupps» rides with the fields it GOVERNS (03.09.): on one screen it spans the
 *     form above both columns, on the stack it leads «Luft & Funk». Section 1 is the Mannschaft
 *     alone, because who is in the Trupp is the one thing the Art does not decide.
 *
 * Leads with the AUFTRAG (what the Trupp is sent to do — the order you check them against on every
 * Kontakt), then the Trupp; the Druck section belongs to Atemschutz alone, and «Art des Trupps»
 * is asked once, at creation, because it cannot be changed afterwards (types · Trupp.kind).
 *
 * ⚠️ There is NO colour picker any more (04.09.), on any layout. The colour is still per-Trupp
 * and still automatic — the field simply stopped being asked; see `color` in `submit`.
