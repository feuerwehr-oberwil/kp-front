// Non-blocking "a new build is ready" message. registerType is 'prompt', so a fresh deploy
// installs and WAITS instead of reloading the app mid-incident; updates found at boot apply
// silently (swUpdate), so this only appears for deploys that land while the operator is already
// working. It ANNOUNCES only: the new version becomes active on the next app start (full close +
// reopen) — the in-place «Neu laden» was removed because skipWaiting activation is unreliable on
// iOS standalone, while a restart always works (decision 2026-07-09). Dismissible, and it
// re-appears on the next deploy. Self-contained: it owns its visibility off the swUpdate
// subscription, so the workspace only has to mount it.
//
// Rank 6 of 7 in the Meldeleiste: the calmest thing there is, and the reason the strip ranks by
// CLASS rather than arrival — it used to sit at the bottom edge on the same coordinate as three
// other cards, and a deploy landing at 3am must never be what the operator reads first.
