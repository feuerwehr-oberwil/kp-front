 * about five phone screens, and the Anwesenheits-Liste read out at the Appell sits at the far
 * end of them. Three tabs put each of those within one screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ It decides what is SHOWN, never the order: the DOM stays in the printed rapport's order
 * (app/report / admin/capturePdf.ts), and from 601px up the bar is `display: none` and every
 * section is on screen exactly as it is today — the two-column layout at 1080 is untouched.
 *
 * ⚠️ THREE, and only three. Anwesenheit and Material were tried as two more tabs here
 * (18.09.2026) and thrown out the same day: this surface already carries a head, a tab strip and
 * a page, and mounting a whole other surface — with ITS head and ITS own switcher — under the
 * strip stacked three navigations on top of each other. They are separate pages again, reached
 * from the bar's «Rapport» tile and its chooser (NavRail · GroupChooser) and from the rail.
