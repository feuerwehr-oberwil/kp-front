   * ⚠️ The Trupp's name is what the rest of the app draws from — the card, the hose tag, the
   * Kroki chip (through `abbreviateName`, which reads the station's name order to decide which
   * token is the surname) and the bold in the Verlauf. Typed «Hans Müller» where the roster says
   * «Müller Hans», all four disagreed at once: one Kroki carrying «Müller H.» beside «Peter S.»,
   * and a Verlauf marking one Trupp's leader and not the other's. The name resolves to the same
   * person either way (lib/personnel · personIdForName) — so it may as well be written down the
   * way the person is spelled everywhere else. A real Gast matches nobody and is left alone.
