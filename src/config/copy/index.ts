// Multilingual UI copy (i18n) — the active locale's string catalogue.
//
// Why this exists: domain language is German, but a single kp-front build serves many
// deployments, and per-station + per-operator language is a real need (Swiss-French/Italian
// regions, mixed crews). All user-facing strings already live in one place; this layer turns
// that single German catalogue into a locale-selectable one WITHOUT touching the ~340
// `appConfig.copy.x` read sites: `appConfig.copy` is a getter that returns `getCopy()`.
//
// Design (deliberately dependency-light, offline-first, no i18n library):
//   • German (`de`) is the canonical base and the source of the `Copy` type.
//   • Every other locale is a `Localizable<Copy>` — a deep-partial whose leaves are widened
//     to plain string/number, so a locale only translates what it wants; anything missing
//     deep-merges back to the German string. A half-translated locale is always complete.
//   • Locale is a PER-DEPLOYMENT setting (one brigade = one language), resolved ONCE at boot
//     from the deployment config's `identity.locale`, falling back to 'de-CH'. main.tsx calls
//     applyLocale() after the deployment config loads. It is set in the admin config editor
//     (Station › Identität › Sprache), not per device.
//
// To add a language: create ./xx.ts exporting `Localizable<Copy>`, register it in LOCALES,
// and add it to AVAILABLE_LOCALES below. Nothing else changes.
