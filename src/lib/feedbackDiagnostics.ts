// The Diagnose-Datei: the part of a Rückmeldung that makes it actionable.
//
// Everything else in the sheet is prose — what the operator typed and a six-line technical
// block. That is enough to say «es ist abgestürzt» and not enough to find anything, so every
// such report used to cost a round trip that begins «hast du die genaue Fehlermeldung». By
// then the app has been reloaded and the moment is gone. This module is that round trip,
// answered in advance: it asks the station's own server for the crash traces it has been
// holding (backend/app/telemetry/recent.py) and hands the operator a file to attach.
//
// It is a FILE and not more text in the mail body for one reason: a mailto: URL carries the
// body as a percent-encoded query string, and browsers and mail clients truncate it — some
// silently, around 2 kB. A stack trace is exactly the thing that would be cut. A file is also
// what a GitHub issue wants, and what the operator can read before deciding to send.
//
// Nothing here decides what the file CONTAINS: the server built and sanitised it. The rule
// that the app never shows the operator one thing and sends another holds by construction,
// because this downloads what it displays.
