/**
 * Every tile of an Einsatzobjekt's sheets, fetched once in the background — so a plan that was
 * on this device while it had a network is WHOLE without one (decided 21.09.2026: prefetch per
 * object, not lazily as you pan; a corner of a Geschossplan nobody happened to look at must not
 * be blank in a cellar at 3am).
 *
 * The fetches only exist to pass through the service worker, whose `plan-tiles` route is
 * cache-first and keeps them (vite.config); nothing is held here. So:
 *  · no controlling service worker (dev server, first visit) → nothing to fill, nothing fetched;
 *  · a source whose LAST tile is already cached is done — tiles are fetched in order, so the
 *    last one is only there when the rest are;
 *  · a pyramid the server has not finished (`complete: false`) is left for the next visit:
 *    asking for every tile now would make the server render the whole sheet on the spot;
 *  · «Datensparmodus» is respected, and two requests at a time leave the radio to the Einsatz.
