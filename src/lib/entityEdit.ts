/**
 * What changed on a tactical symbol, in words — the Verlauf line for editing the Kroki.
 *
 * The Kroki is the picture the Einsatz is led from, and until now the record said only that a
 * symbol had been PLACED, MOVED or REMOVED. Everything that happens to it in between — the
 * Stockwerk it turns out to be on, the name of the Einsatzleiter typed into its field, the
 * Anzahl going from one Person to three, an Ausbreitung appearing — was written straight into
 * the document with no row at all. So the Verlauf recorded the moment a symbol appeared and
 * then nothing, while the picture it describes went on changing for two hours.
 *
 * Pure, and it names the VALUE, never just the field: «Stockwerk geändert» sends a reader to the
 * replay to find out what it became, which is the one thing a printed record cannot do.
 *
 * ⚠️ Geometry is deliberately absent. Dragging, rotating and resizing happen continuously while
 * somebody arranges the picture; a row per nudge would bury the four or five edits that carry
 * meaning. `objectMoved` still logs a move as its own event, and the replay holds every frame.

/**
 * Which of a symbol's roster fields have to be re-filed against the Anwesenheit after an edit.
 *
 * A name typed into «Fahrer», «Name» or «Stv.» is a job handed to somebody who is standing there,
 * and filing it marks them present and writes their Funktion — which is a Verlauf row. So this
 * has to answer «what actually moved», and nothing else: re-filing an unchanged field re-opens a
 * presence block somebody closed on purpose and re-states a Funktion that never changed.
 *
 * ⚠️ A missing key and an empty one are the SAME thing (04.09.). The panel seeds every preset
 * field as a row, blank ones included, and commits the whole record — so a symbol that had never
 * carried a «Bezeichnung» suddenly carried `''`, `undefined !== ''` said a field had moved, and
 * every roster field on the symbol was re-filed. That is how naming the Einsatzleiter at 08:10
 * re-stated a Stv. set at 08:01.
 *
 * ⚠️ `force`, and a changed NON-roster field, still re-file everybody — deliberately. The
 * Bemerkung a field writes is built from the symbol's label and its other fields («Fahrer TLF»),
 * so when one of those moves, the name beside it has to reach the Anwesenheit again even though
 * the name itself did not change (lib/roleAssignment · rosterFieldRole).
