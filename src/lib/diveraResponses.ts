// The Anwesenheit's «Anrückend» block, as data: who answered the Divera alarm «kommt» / «kommt
// nicht», laid over the Mannschaft and over who is already here. Yes / no and names only (owner,

//
// ⚠️ A Divera answer is NEVER presence. This module only sorts the answers into what the block
// shows; somebody is anwesend once a person on the scene taps «da», which is the ordinary
// attendance write (useAttendanceActions · markPresent) and nothing here.
