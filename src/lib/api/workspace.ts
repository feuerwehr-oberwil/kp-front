 * save wakes every follower, the saving device's own too, which then downloaded the whole blob it
 * had just sent (~38 KB gzipped on the busiest Einsatz on record) — on every edit (18.10.2026).
 * With the id, a range of revisions that is nothing but this engine's saves is the 304 with
 * `X-Workspace-Rev` → `{ ownRev }`. The server decides, and only from what it has on record:
 * any revision it cannot vouch for as this engine's is the blob, as before.
