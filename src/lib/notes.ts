 * One place for everything a free-text note needs to agree on across the four renderers that
 * draw it: the Lage map (MapMarkers), the Plan whiteboard (Whiteboard), the client-side PDF
 * (reportPdfDirect) and the server-side sheet (backend/app/kroki.py). The Python side mirrors
 * these numbers — see `NOTE_SIZE_SCALE` / `_note_lines` there; a change here needs a change
 * there, or paper stops matching the screen.
 *
 * A note is a one-line pill until it has a WIDTH, at which point it wraps and grows downwards.
 * Width is per-surface because the surfaces scale differently: `BoardAnno.wN` is a fraction of
 * the plan width (so it survives zoom and prints 1:1), `Entity.noteW` is screen px (map notes
 * are pinned to a constant screen size). Everything else lives on the shared `SymbolProps`.

// --- auto width (a fresh note sizes itself to what is typed) ---------------------------------
//
// A note is placed mid-sentence and then TYPED. Seeding every one at the surface default meant a
// three-word Notiz sat in a box wide enough for a paragraph, and the operator had to drag it
// narrower to get the picture back — for the most common note there is. So a fresh note follows
// its text: it grows from the minimum until it hits the maximum, at which point it wraps as
// before. The moment the width is dragged by hand that decision stands (`noteAutoW` is cleared)
// and nothing resizes under the operator again.
//
// The measured result is still STORED as a plain width. That is deliberate: the client PDF and
// the server sheet (backend/app/kroki.py) lay a note out from its width, and neither can run a
// browser text measurement — so «auto» has to collapse to a number here, at edit time, or paper
// would stop matching the screen.
