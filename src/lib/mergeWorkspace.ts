// Three-way merge of two divergent workspace blobs against their common ancestor (the last
// revision both devices shared). This is what turns concurrent multi-device editing from
// "one whole snapshot wins, the other's work is lost" into a real merge, the way Miro/Figma
// resolve it:
//   - independent additions to different objects all survive (ordered by server appearance);
//   - edits to the SAME object are last-writer-wins (the device flushing later wins) — except
//     Trupps, which merge field-level (mergeTrupp) because an SCBA record must never lose a
//     pressure reading to a concurrent radio contact, and Anwesenheit entries and Zeitplan
//     shifts, which merge per field (mergeFields) so two devices saving different fields of one
//     record in the same second both keep their edit;
//   - a delete BEATS a concurrent edit — the object stays gone, no resurrection;
//   - two devices that minted the same «Trupp N» at once end with ONE holder of the number, the
//     others renumbered from the one counter (lib/truppNumbers — the last step of mergeWorkspace).
//
// The `base` ancestor is the crux: it lets us tell "I deleted X" (present in base, absent in
// mine) apart from "I never had X" (absent in both base and mine). Without it a naive union
// can't honor deletes and would resurrect everything the other device removed.

 * never clobbers a concurrent edit in another:
 *   - object collections (entities, drawings, timeline, trupps, cameraViews, trails, board) → per-object
 *     three-way by id (independent adds survive, same object is LWW-mine, delete beats edit);
 *   - records (vehicleOverrides, checklists, attendance, planScale) and singletons (settings,
 *     reportMeta, building, pickedObjectId) → three-way by value, so a field the resolver didn't
 *     touch yields to the server's concurrent change instead of being reverted.
 * Only genuinely LOCAL view/device state stays mine (the `'local'` rows of MERGE_POLICY:
 * activePlanId, activeModule, layerState, recent, weather, schemaVersion). A key this build does
 * not know at all rides with mine too, as it always has.
 * (Same-object field-level edits remain LWW-mine for every collection except trupps, attendance and
 * shifts — see the documented limitation in the tests, mergeTrupp and mergeFields.)
 *
 * `onAttendanceConflict` (optional) reports every attendance key BOTH sides changed to different
 * values (same person, divergent entries — e.g. QR capture vs. KP tablet). The merge result is
 * unchanged (LWW); the caller appends a Verlauf note so the divergence is reviewable.
 *
 * `onTruppConflict` (optional) reports every Trupp BOTH sides changed concurrently. Unlike
 * attendance, the merge here is field-level (mergeTrupp) so nothing is silently dropped — but
 * two devices writing the same SCBA crew's record at once is still worth a human look, so the
 * caller appends a Verlauf note the same way. `key` = the Trupp id, mine/theirs = both objects.
 *
 * `base` and `theirs` are coerced first (asList / asRecord): `mine` is this app's own
 * buildPayload and clean, the other two are whatever the server and the cached ancestor hold.
 * A collection that is not an array merges as empty rather than throwing — the throw used to
 * wedge sync silently and forever (badge stuck on «ausstehend», no toast, re-thrown every retry).
 *
 * `opts.numbers` — which «Trupp N» collisions this merge settles (lib/truppNumbers · NumberScope):
 * `all` by default; a slice session passes what its push can carry (WorkspaceSync · numberScope).
