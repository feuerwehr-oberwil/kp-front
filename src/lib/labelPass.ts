/**
 * ONE arbitration pass over every label the Lage map wants to draw.
 *
 * Until now six independent loops each put their label where their own geometry pointed, and
 * none of them looked at the others. The only declutter was a switch — `captionMinZoom`, i.e.
 * "below z16 no captions, from z16 ALL of them". At z16 a 28px glyph covers ~45m of ground and
 * its 120px caption covers ~194m; a Zimmerbrand Schadenplatz is ~50m wide. So the switch turned
 * every name on at exactly the moment they all overlapped, and `text-overflow: ellipsis` was
 * the collision strategy. Both are gone.
 *
 * The replacement is variant A · **Verdrängen**: one fixed rank order, one AABB test per
 * candidate, and **nothing ever moves**. A label either stands exactly where it belongs or it
 * is not drawn at all — and where it is not drawn, its glyph carries a 6px ink dot so the
 * operator can see that a name exists there. No spiral search, no displacement, no leader lines.
 *
 * What makes that safe is the exemption: **the current selection is never suppressed**, and
 * everything else yields to it. Any hidden name is one tap from readable, and the label that
 * appears is guaranteed to sit on its true position — so belonging is never ambiguous.
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything here is SCREEN PIXELS. A decision taken in world coordinates that cleared at
 * z17 is covered again at z16; the pass has to be re-run per view, which is why the caller
 * feeds it projected boxes and re-runs on `moveend`.
