/**
 * Pins the app's chrome to the SCREEN while iOS pans the page under a keyboard.
 *
 * The document itself can no longer scroll (02-base.css · `body { position: fixed }`), which is
 * what stopped the whole app being draggable and stopped `position: fixed` chrome riding up with
 * a focus scroll. What is left is the VISUAL viewport: to keep a focused field above the
 * keyboard iOS pans it, and everything laid out in the layout viewport — which is all of the
 * chrome — appears to slide up with it. A native app's top bar and tab bar do not travel; they
 * stay put and let the keyboard cover what it covers.
 *
 * `visualViewport.offsetTop` is exactly how far that pan has gone, so writing it to `--vv-pan`
 * lets the two bars translate straight back down to where they belong (see 15-mobile.css).
 *
 * ⚠️ CHROME ONLY, never the content. Counter-translating the box that CONTAINS the caret is the
 * feedback loop this app has already been bitten by (see useKeyboardInset): the field moves back
 * under the keyboard, iOS pans further to reveal it, which moves it again. The top bar and the
 * nav rail hold no text field, so moving them cannot make iOS re-aim.
 *
 * ⚠️ Written to the documentElement rather than returned as state. The pan updates continuously
 * while iOS animates, and a per-frame React re-render of the whole workspace is the shape of the
 * battery bug this app has had once already (the media-queue commit storm). A CSS custom property
 * moves the bars on the compositor and costs no render at all.
 *
 * …and the BOTTOM of the visible band, as `--vv-foot` (30.09.2026, staging phone pass: «this
 * strange» — the Rapport ended ~115px above the keys, the Trupp sheet stood off them). Everything
 * placed from the layout viewport's bottom needs it once iOS pans: the keyboard's height alone
 * (`innerHeight − vv.height`) ignores the pan, so a sheet lifted by it floated `offsetTop` above
 * the keys, and a page that kept its reserve for the bars — which this hook sends down behind the
 * keyboard — ended that reserve plus the pan above them. `keyboardFootNow` is the keyboard less
 * the pan; sheets stand on it (keyboardLift), pages end on it (Surface.module.css · .shell), and
 * `data-kb` on the root says a keyboard is up at all (15-mobile.css). The same one write per
 * frame, never a render.
