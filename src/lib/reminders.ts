// Pendenzen (open items), derived from the append-only Verlauf stream.
//
// The journal never edits or removes a row (see the kp-front-journal note), so an open item's
// lifecycle is a SEQUENCE of events sharing one `reminder.id`:
//   - `created`  → carries the text, and a `dueAt` only if it is a timed Erinnerung
//   - `note`     → a later row reporting what happened, without closing it
//   - `snoozed`  → a later row with a new `dueAt` (timed Erinnerungen only)
//   - `done`     → a later row that closes it
// The open set, each item's *effective* due time and its latest Meldung are derived here — never
// stored as mutable fields. This keeps everything correct under offline merge + replay for free.
//
// ⚠️ Two kinds live in one list, and the difference that matters is the `dueAt`:
//   - WITHOUT one: a Pendenz. Open until done, never alarms. There are no check-ins on a
//     Schadenplatz, so a due time on an Auftrag would be a fiction — you would only be alerting
//     yourself. What you want to know is how long it has been running, which the created time says.
//   - WITH one: today's Erinnerung, unchanged — banner, tone, OS notification, +10 min.
