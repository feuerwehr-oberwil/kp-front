/**
 * Pinch/wheel zoom on the full-size picture. A document photo is often read for a detail —
 * a Kennzeichen, a Gefahrgutnummer, the small print on a Gasflasche — and «so gross wie der
 * Bildschirm» is not always big enough. The maths is lib/photoZoom; this is the wiring:
 *
 * - two fingers pinch AND pan (the spot under the fingers stays under them); the wheel zooms
 *   about the cursor;
 * - one finger (or the mouse) pans while zoomed in;
 * - touch: a DOUBLE tap zooms in about the spot / back to the fit (iOS Photos). A single tap on
 *   the dark letterbox around the picture closes, as does a push DOWN at the fit (the same
 *   «let go» rule as the bottom sheets, overlays/swipeDismiss) — on a full-screen phone viewer
 *   there is no backdrop left to tap;
 * - mouse: a SINGLE click zooms in/out. The surface shows a zoom cursor, so a click is what anyone
 *   tries first; it sat behind a double-click before and did nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ Gestures live HERE, on the frame (`touch-action: none`): the app blocks page zoom
 * (`maximum-scale=1`, `touch-action: pan-x pan-y` on body), so a pinch the browser handled would
 * do nothing at all. ⚠️ Wheel is a native non-passive listener: React's onWheel is passive, its
 * preventDefault is ignored.
