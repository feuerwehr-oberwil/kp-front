 * *ONE page head, ONE ROW* (28.09.2026, owner: «fix the headers, especially the one from the
 * trupps, which occupies way too much vertical space … as much space for the actual content as
 * possible»). Trupps (the Atemschutz-Link board too), Anwesenheit, Material, Checkliste and
 * Rapport wear one shape at every width ≥ 360: the titles block left — the `<h2>` and AT MOST
 * one quiet line under it («✓ Gespeichert», the counts, the Checkliste's subtitle) — the tiles
 * right, centred on each other; `--tap` + `--head-pad-y` above and below (60px on a phone, 68
 * above; Surface.module.css · `.head`, tokens · `--head-*`). What does not fit gives up WORDS,
 * MEASURED, never per breakpoint (`lib/pageHeadFit` · `usePageHeadFit`, on the top bar's
 * `climbLadder`): (1) the quiet line's time («Gespeichert um 23:21» → «Gespeichert»), (2) each
 * tile's word, lowest priority first — the glyph stays, the word is already its aria-label/title
 * so the hold-tooltip says it, a count stays with its glyph («⚠ 4»), (3) the one primary tile
 * shortens («+ Trupp anmelden» → «+ Trupp»; it keeps its word and its fill), then a head's own
 * last words (the quiet «✓ Gespeichert» keeps its ✓ — a LOUD sync state never folds; the
 * Rapport's title says the nav's «Rapport»), and only as the LAST resort (≤ 359px, a locale that
 * cannot fit) the tiles take a second row (`data-fit-wrap`). Each head states its ladder where
 * its tiles are drawn — `data-fold="<rank>"` on the part, `.fold-long` / `.fold-short` inside
 * it (`HEAD_FOLD` in AtemschutzView / AnwesenheitView, `RP_FOLD` in ReportPreflight); text that
 * must never be cut wears `data-fit-check`, and every `<h2>` is checked. A new tile takes a rank
 * in that ladder — never a `useIsPhone` word switch, never a `@media` that drops a label, never
 * a row of its own. The 27.09. «Trupps head: the title line, then the tile row under it» (a
 * 121px phone head, 190 on the 820 tablet with «+ Trupp anmelden» wrapped to a third row) is
 * superseded, and so is «icons below 1080px» on the Rapport. The one tile family stays:
 * `.headTile` (Atemschutz.module.css) / `.head-tile` (13-incident.css).

/**
 * The PAGE HEAD's ladder (28.09.2026, owner: «fix the headers … as much space for the actual
 * content as possible») — Trupps, Anwesenheit, Material, Checkliste and Einsatzrapport, the
 * Atemschutz-Link board included.
 *
 * A page head is ONE ROW: the titles block on the left (the <h2> and at most one quiet line
 * under it — «✓ Gespeichert», the counts), the tiles on the right, centred on each other. What
 * does not fit gives up WORDS, measured rather than ruled per breakpoint — the top bar's way
 * (lib/useHeadFit), on the same `climbLadder`:
 *
 *   1. the quiet line drops its time («Gespeichert um 23:21» → «Gespeichert»),
 *   2. the tiles drop their word one at a time, lowest priority first — the icon stays, the word
 *      is already the tile's aria-label/title, so the hold-tooltip still says it; a count stays
 *      with its icon («⚠ 4»),
 *   3. the one primary tile shortens («+ Trupp anmelden» → «+ Trupp»; it keeps its word and fill),
 *   4. the quiet line keeps its MARK («✓» — the sentence stays its `title`, and a LOUD state never
 *      folds: it is not a quiet line). That is the handed-over phone board's quiet state since
 *      09.09., and what buys the 390px Trupps head its one row while an alarm tile stands,
 *   5. the tiles close up: 6px apart and 8px inside a worded tile (`data-fit-tight` — the top bar's
 *      «gaps» rung; every tile stays a tap wide), which is what fits a 360px phone,
 *   6. only then — ≤ 359px, or a locale that cannot fit — the tiles take a second row (and open up
 *      again: that row has the room).
 *
 * The contract is markup, so every head states its own ladder where its tiles are drawn:
 *   - `data-fold="<rank>"` on each part that can give (the quiet line, a tile). Lower ranks give
 *     first; parts sharing a rank give together. The ranks PRESENT are the steps — a tile that is
 *     not rendered (no alarm, nothing deleted) costs no step. A part that gives twice lists two
 *     ranks (`data-fold="1 8"`: the time first, the word much later).
 *   - inside it, `.fold-long` is what shows until the part is folded and `.fold-short` what shows
 *     after; at its second rank the short goes too and the glyph stands alone (13-incident.css ·
 *     «fold»). A tile that goes icon-only has no `.fold-short`.
 *   - `data-fit-check` on text that must not be cut (a sync line, the Rapport's chip label); every
 *     <h2> in the head is checked anyway, except one marked `data-fit-free` (a title that is
 *     SUPPOSED to truncate, like the handed-over phone board's Einsatz name).
 * The head gets `data-folded="<level>"` on each folded part (how many of its ranks have come),
 * `data-fit="<step>"` on itself, `data-fit-tight` at the step before last and `data-fit-wrap` at the
 * last (Surface.module.css · the wrap).
