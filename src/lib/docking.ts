// tank it describes.
//
// …and since 15.09. a TRUPP MARKER docks the same way: dropped beside a symbol (a door, a
// hydrant, a vehicle) it is «bei» that object — the board card says so, and the marker rides
// along when the host is moved. Same bond, same radius, same release gesture.
//
// Deliberately narrower than the magnetic line machinery (lib/lineAttachments): no dwell ring,
// no ports, no resolve-at-render — the bond is decided once, on drop, and the placard keeps its
// own honest coordinate. Karte-only, like the ERG rings: on a Plan the placard sits inside a
// drawn Kroki where «daneben» already says everything, and a normalized surface has no metric
// drop radius to reason about.
