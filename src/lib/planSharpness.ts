 * «Is the plan on the glass as sharp as this view asks?» — what a plan reader tells the surface it
 * sits in (owner, Karte review round 3, 17.10.2026: «if you zoom in quickly before things have
 * loaded, everything is blurry … we need a way to indicate that the plan is still loading»).
 *
 * The reader draws a soft picture first and sharpens it as the detail arrives
 * (components/PlanTileLayer: an always-there underlay, then the tiles of the level the zoom asks
 * for). In an Einsatz the tiles are prepared on the device ahead of time (lib/planTilePrefetch);
 * on the Karte they come over the network on demand, so «soft» can last — or, offline, never end.
 *
 * ⚠️ Opt-in, by context: only a surface that PROVIDES `PlanSharpnessContext` hears anything (today
 * the Karte, components/karte/KartePlans · KartePlanBoard). The Einsatz's own Plan surface
 * provides none, so it neither shows the chip nor fetches ahead.
