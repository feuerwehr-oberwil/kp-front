/**
 * Keeps the FOCUSED text field above the on-screen keyboard, app-wide. Mounted once, at the
 * workspace root (IncidentWorkspace) — a keyboard is one thing per screen, so this is one
 * listener, not one per surface.
 *
 * Why the browser does not already do it: `body { position: fixed }` (02-base.css) leaves the
 * document with nothing to scroll, so Safari's native "reveal the caret" pass can only work
 * inside a NESTED scroller — and it gets exactly one shot, fired the moment the field takes
 * focus, i.e. while the keyboard is still sliding in and the geometry is still pre-shrink. On an
 * iPad the field it just "revealed" then ends up under the keys anyway.
 *
 * So there are two triggers, and the second one is the point:
 *   · `focusin` — covers moving between fields while the keyboard is already up, where the
 *     geometry is already correct;
 *   · a new non-zero `useKeyboardInset` value — re-aims at whatever is focused NOW, once the
 *     keyboard has actually settled and any React re-render it caused has landed.
 *
 * ⚠️ Both triggers go through the same OVERFLOW GUARD, and it is load-bearing: scroll only when
 * the field's box actually falls outside the visual viewport, and then only by `block: 'nearest'`.
 * An unconditional `block: 'center'` re-enters the pan/re-aim feedback loop documented in
 * useKeyboardInset — we move the field, iOS pans to keep the caret visible, which moves the field
 * again. «Nearest» moves the minimum and stops; a field already on screen is left alone entirely.
