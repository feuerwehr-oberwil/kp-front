/**
 * The unified tactical object — ONE record per object, whatever surface it stands on
 * (tmp/design-unified-objects.md, decided 09.09.2026). This retires «being on one side»:
 * an object is simply a thing in the Einsatz, rendered wherever its position is knowable.
 *
 * Two bodies, both in their surface's OWN vocabulary (the units genuinely differ — metres
 * vs. plan-width fractions, LngLat vs. per-floor sheet points — so pretending one
 * coordinate fits both would be a lie the print/render paths pay for):
 *
 *   · `entity` XOR `drawing` — the map body, exactly what the Karte renders.
 *   · `sheet` — the sheet body: which plan, and exactly what that plan renders.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ANCHOR IS THE SHEET BODY'S PRESENCE. An object hand-placed on a sheet carries
 * `sheet` (sheet coords are its truth; the map body is BAKED through the georef fit and
 * re-baked when the fit changes). An object hand-placed on the Karte carries no `sheet`
 * at all — geo is its truth, and a linked plan shows it by live projection, exactly like
 * the old twins. A drag flips the anchor to the surface it happened on: dragging a sheet
 * object on the Karte DROPS the sheet body (geo becomes truth), dragging a map object on
 * a sheet CREATES one. «Last hand-placement owns the truth.»
 *
 * Reference change/delete loses nothing: a sheet-anchored object keeps its sheet coords
 * AND its last-baked map body; a geo-anchored object keeps geo and merely stops appearing
 * on the unlinked sheet.

 * converts between them (`turnedToGround`, planProjection · turnedToSheet). `entitySharedProps`
 * spread the ground bearing straight into the paper's frame, for EVERY sheet-anchored object in
 * every Karte write, changed or not — so each «Karte write → bake» cycle turned the glyph by
 * `−rotationDeg`. On the Gebäude stack (rotationDeg −41.49) the live-GPS loop ran that cycle
 * continuously: one Lüfter ended at 66 735°, and every re-bake of the plan turned all of them at
 * once («ich drehe einen Lüfter, und alle drehen sich»).
 *
 * The exact inverse of the bake, in geometry AND in absence:
 *   · a bearing the write did not change — the map body's own, or exactly what the bake of this
 *     anno says — keeps the anno's value VERBATIM. Converting it would be a round trip through
 *     floating point on every write; not converting it is the identity.
 *   · a changed one crosses through `turnedToSheet`, with the same «is it directional» the
 *     projection asks (`directionalGlyph`, and `rotation2` only where there is one) — so an absent
 *     ground bearing becomes the paper's own turn, which bakes straight back to absent.
 *   · a glyph with no direction is copied verbatim, exactly as the bake copies it.
 *   · no fit (an unlinked sheet): the ground bearing cannot be said on this paper at all, so the
 *     anno keeps its own.
 * Only symbols and Formen turn with the paper; a note's `rotation` is paper decoration that the
 * bake never converts, so it keeps crossing as itself.

 *     is exactly the statement that it no longer stands on that sheet.
 *
 *     ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION, accepted for now (see kp-front-sync-limitations). The flip is a
 *     FIELD REMOVAL, and `mergeWorkspace` merges an object field-wise, last-writer-wins: a
 *     concurrent edit on another device that still carries the sheet body can therefore bring
 *     it back, and the object is sheet-anchored again at coordinates nobody chose. The record
 *     needs a «this body was deliberately dropped» marker (a tombstone or an explicit anchor
 *     enum) rather than absence, which is a schema change and belongs with the reference
 *     semantics of phase 3.
 *   · re-styled only → the sheet keeps the anchor, and the shared props are written through
 *     onto its anno, where the next bake reads them back.
 *   · gone from the document → deleted on the Karte, and deleting an object deletes the object.
 *     A sheet object with no baked body was never on the Karte to delete, so its absence says
 *     nothing about it and it stays.
 *
 * Geo-anchored objects are replaced wholesale by the document, absence meaning deletion, as
 * before. Sheet-anchored records keep their store order; new map objects append.
