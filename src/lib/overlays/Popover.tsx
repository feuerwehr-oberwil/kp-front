/**
 * Anchored, non-modal popover — wraps Base UI's Popover. The Positioner anchors to the trigger
 * (collision-aware, auto-flips near a viewport edge), replacing hand-rolled
 * getBoundingClientRect math, and Base UI supplies outside-click + Esc dismissal and focus
 * management — so a hand-rolled full-screen scrim is no longer needed. The popup is portalled to
 * <body>, escaping any `backdrop-filter` containing block (the old reason the weather scrim was
 * trapped to the TopBar).
 *
 * Uncontrolled by default (the trigger toggles it); pass `open`/`onOpenChange` to control it.
 * ANCHOR mode (`anchor`, 04.11.2026 – the Wassertransport's pump bubble): a controlled popover
 * opens AT an element that is no trigger – a dot on a chart, a marker on the map – and the
 * trigger may be left out. The element's own tap handler opens and closes it; `onOpenChange`'s
 * second argument says why Base UI wants it closed, so that handler's own press can be ignored
 * (it would otherwise close the popover, and the tap reopen it).
 * PERSISTENT mode (05.11.2026 – the «Üben» Sprechblase, components/tutorial): a controlled popover
 * that stands while the learner works AROUND it – it ignores the close requests, takes no focus
 * (`takeFocus={false}`, so a field being typed in keeps the keys) and does not register with the
 * popoverGuard (`guard={false}`: it is no transient layer, and a standing entry there would leave
 * every Sheet deaf to its backdrop and Esc). `arrowClassName` draws Base UI's Arrow at the anchor.
 * NOTE: for surfaces that must NOT be dismissed/focus-managed and must let the map stay live
 * underneath (map tool-docks like MapViewsMenu), keep the hand-rolled dock — do not use this.
