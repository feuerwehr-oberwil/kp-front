 * number underlined and anchored. The Rapport has no colour to spend — bold is what a reader
 * already reads as «this is a name», and an underline what they read as «this can be followed».
 * The PDF's own reader turns the anchor into a tap — a `tel:` one straight into a call, which is
 * the whole point of the callback number a Meldung leaves in the entry text; on paper the address
 * and the number are still written out, which is why the text and not a label gets printed.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the ONE place phone numbers are marked (`MarkOptions.phone`): the on-screen Verlauf
 * stays text-only on them, deliberately — see `MarkOptions`.
 *
 * `esc` is the caller's XML escaping and is applied to the href as well — an address can carry
 * an «&» between its query parameters, and one unescaped ampersand costs the whole page.
 *
 * ⚠️ Returns `undefined` when the row marked nothing at all, so the backend falls back to its own
 * escaping of the plain text rather than storing markup that says nothing (see report.ts).
