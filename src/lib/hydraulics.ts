// Wassertransport — the pressure along a hose relay and where its pumps go. No React, no copy:
// Messen › Strecke and the Leitung editor both drive it through lib/useRelay, and the validated
// click prototype (03.11.2026) is its origin. Pure but for
// ONE read: `hoseDefaults()`, the station's doctrine for the Ø a Leitung or a Messen relay
// starts on (deployment config `doctrine.defaultLineHose` / `defaultRelayHose`).
//
// ⚠️ Which Ø a Leitung without a stored one reads as (`lineHose`, lead 05.11.2026; owner
// 14.11.2026): one that carries a Wassertransport (`relay`) is a TRANSPORT line and reads as the
// relay default (75) – the Leitungen laid since #536 (04.11.2026) were computed on it and must not
// re-plan; a plain one has NO Ø until somebody picks one («schlauch should be empty by default and
// not 40mm»), unless the station sets a Linie default (`doctrine.defaultLineHose`). A Ø picked by
// hand always wins. Adding a relay in the line editor writes the Ø out in the same edit
// (`relayAddPatch`), so the «Schlauch» row never jumps from «Kein» to 75 under the operator's finger.
//
// ⚠️ The numbers are doctrine, not tuning. Friction: AGV Kantonale Beilage Basiswissen KB 06.06
// (55 mm), 06.07 (75 mm), 06.08 (110 mm), «Druckverlust in bar» per 100 m by the flow in ONE line.
// The AGV set has no 40 mm table; that one is GVB «Behelf für den Einsatz von TLF und MS» (2023),
// «Wassertransport · Tabellen», the ø 40 table's 100 m column — its ø 55 and ø 75 tables are the
// AGV values row for row, so it is the same doctrine. Height: 1 bar per 10 m (FKS Reglement 06.29). A pump needs
// at least 2 bar at its inlet (FKS 06.42) — which is where an automatic pump is placed. It is a
// PLANUNGSHILFE: the surfaces say so and name these sources (components/WaterRelay).
