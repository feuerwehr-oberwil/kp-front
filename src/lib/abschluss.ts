// Abschluss-Assistent step model: which of the guided closing steps are satisfied by the
// incident data. Pure derivation — the assistant never stores its own progress; reopening
// it weeks later shows the true state (the 3am tenet: recognition, no memorized state).

import type { ReportMeta } from './workspace'

// 'verlauf' was dropped 2026-07-08: system rows make the journal non-empty on every real
// incident, so the check was always-green noise on the closing list.
//
// 'einsatzleiter' was added 2026-08-03: the four Mindestangaben for the digital close are
// Einsatzende, Einsatzleiter, Kurzbericht and at least one person — but only three of them
// were ever checked, so a rapport could close with nobody named as having led the incident.
// Printing is deliberately unaffected: it never blocks, a missing field prints as an empty
// line to fill in by hand (form model 2026-07-17).
// 'abschluss' → 'kurzbericht' 2026-08-07: the step checks `summary`, the Kurzbericht — but it was
// named after the thing it is a step OF, so the confirm read «Noch offen: Abschluss. Trotzdem
// abschliessen?» in a dialog titled «Einsatz abschliessen». A step has to name the field it wants
// filled in; that sentence named the button that was already pressed.
//
// 'rueckmeldung' was added 2026-08-08: whether the ELZ was told the Einsatz is over is a fact
// with a right answer, unlike the Bemerkungen and Lehren it shares its section with — those are
// prose and are legitimately empty on a routine Einsatz, so requiring them would leave the chip
// amber on nearly every rapport and teach the eye to skip it. Named after the FIELD, not after
// the «Nachbearbeitung» section it sits in — see the note above about 'abschluss'.
// 'kontaktperson' was split out from 'einsatzleiter' on 2026-08-11. They are two different
// people answering two different questions — who LED the Einsatz, and who on site the Wehr
// dealt with (Hauswart, Betreiber, Anwohner) — and they sit in one grid, so a single chip
// pointed at both and highlighted both. It is also a fact with a right answer, like the
// Einsatzleiter and unlike the prose beside it.
//
// 'kontaktperson' and 'rueckmeldung' got an «Entfällt» on 2026-08-22, the escape 'mittel' had
// had all along. Both are facts with a right answer AND with a legitimate «gibt es nicht» — a
// Fehlalarm has no contact, an Ölspur is not reported back to the ELZ — so without one the
// rapport of a routine Einsatz could never reach complete, and the «Angaben fehlen noch»
// confirm stood in front of every print until it was being dismissed unread.
//
// 'abweichungen' was added 2026-09-04, out of the 03.09. Rapport review. When the QR-Bogen and a
// tablet wrote the same person at the same moment, the merge kept one value and the Verlauf got
// a «bitte prüfen» line — and that Rapport was closed at 11:41 with three of them standing. A
// warning in the journal is not proof that anybody looked: it is proof that the app noticed.
// So an unsettled divergence is a step like the seven above it, and it BLOCKS NOTHING — the
// button reads «Trotzdem abschliessen», exactly as it does for a missing Kurzbericht. A hard
// refusal at 02:00 over a Funktion nobody can reconstruct would leave the Einsatz standing open
// in the Historie for ever, which is the worse record. The step is satisfied by zero open
// divergences, which is the ordinary case: most Einsätze never produce one at all.
