"""Weather at an active Einsatz, observed ONCE, by the server — and the wind shift it implies.

Why server-side (24.09.2026, post-mortem of the Feueralarm-Übung on 23.09.2026, D2 item 27):
every open device polled `/api/weather` and emitted a `weather.observe` audit event per new
reading, so one reading entered the record once per device (×1–5), and not at all while every
screen was asleep. The replay reads these events to show the wind as it stood at any instant
(`src/lib/replay · stateAt`), so the record needs exactly one per reading, whoever is looking.

The scheduler now observes every ``WEATHER_OBSERVE_SECONDS`` per ACTIVE Einsatz
(`vehicle_presence.active_incidents`: open, started within 24 h, real coordinate), and writes
ONE event under the derived id ``wx:<incident>:<observed_at>`` in the shape the client emitted —
``weather.observe`` with ``{"weather": WeatherData}`` — so the replay reads it unchanged. The
same reading seen again (MeteoSwiss publishes every 10 min, the job can tick between) is the
same id and writes nothing. The client's emit is gone; an older build's copy is dropped at the
ingest endpoint (`api/events · SERVER_OBSERVED_OPS`).

Wind shift (D2-c): each observation is compared with the ESTABLISHED wind. A turn of at least
``WIND_SHIFT_DEG`` at ``WIND_SHIFT_MIN_KMH`` or more, held over two consecutive observations on
the same side, from the same source and station, writes ONE Verlauf row «Wind dreht: W → NO
(286° → 66°) · Lüfter prüfen» under a derived id (``wxd-<observed_at>`` of the confirming
reading) — the devices show it once in their Meldeleiste (`src/components/WindShiftMeldung`),
timed from the row's `writtenAt`. The fold is pure over the whole series of readings, so a
restart or a second worker computes the same shift and the same id.
