"""Vehicle presence, observed ONCE, by the server: «vor Ort» / «hat den Einsatzort verlassen».

Why this is server-side (24.09.2026, post-mortem of the Übung on 23.09.2026, design D2). The
client hook this replaces (`src/lib/useVehiclePresenceLog.ts`, deleted) ran on every editor
device and stamped a transition at the moment THAT device noticed it. #204 made its row ids
deterministic, so three tablets converged on one row — but the time on the row was still «when
some device woke up»: the trackers had the first three vehicles on scene at 19:23–19:24, the
Verlauf had all five at 19:43, the moment a tablet was unlocked. A vehicle's arrival is a fact
about the track, not about a screen, so the one process that sees every position whether or not
anybody is looking — the scheduler's 30 s sweep — records it.

⚠️ «The time» is the tracker's own report time: Traccar's `deviceTime` (`VehiclePosition.
last_update`), which is the device clock at the fix, not Traccar's `fixTime` and not the server's
receipt. A time in the FUTURE (a tracker with a wrong clock) is capped at the server's now — an
event dated after «now» would stop the replay short of it.

The rules are the client's, number for number (keep them identical — a mixed-version day
compares the two):

* ≤ ``AT_SCENE_M`` is «vor Ort», ≥ ``LEFT_M`` is «weg», the band between says nothing (it
  neither starts nor ends a state — see `zone_of`);
* a new zone has to hold for ``SETTLE_S`` before it counts, and the transition is stamped with
  the FIRST reading in the new zone;
* the first reading of a vehicle is a silent BASELINE, never a row: an Einsatz opened with the
  TLF already parked at the scene has no arrival time anybody can know.

What reaches the record (D2, ★ picks):

* one ``vehicle.presence`` audit event per transition (and one for the baseline), under the
  derived id ``vp:<device>:<n>`` — the machine record every later tick, restart or second
  worker rebuilds from and converges on;
* the Verlauf gets the FIRST arrival and the LAST departure per vehicle, nothing in between
  (D2-a): a vehicle shuttling to the depot has its runs counted («3 Fahrten») in
  `reportMeta.fahrzeuge[].gps` and shown in the vehicle table and the Rapport. «Last» is only
  known once the vehicle stays away, so a departure's row is written when the vehicle has been
  gone ``FINAL_AWAY_S`` — or when observation of the Einsatz ends — stamped with the departure's
  own time. The Verlauf orders by `at`, so the row stands where it happened;
* the Rapport's «vor Ort» clock (`reportMeta.fahrzeuge[].vorOrt`) through the same CAS the
  milestone webhook writes with (`api/alarms · cas_workspace`). FIRST WRITER WINS against the
  external geofence (D2-b), `manual` rows keep their time, and the server records that the
  clock is its own in ``gps.owns``. ⚠️ `zurueck` is NOT the server's: in the milestone vocabulary
  it means «back at the depot», which the geofence knows and the scene rings do not. The scene
  departure lives in ``gps.ab`` only (decided 25.09.2026).

Row ids are the server's own shape, ``vps-<n>-<zone>-gps-<device>``. A device still on the
previous build writes ``vp-<n>-<zone>-gps-<device>`` — an old row under that id must never
swallow the server's (the journal skips a known id), and a new one is dropped at the endpoint
(`api/journal · observed_by_server`).

«Active» (`observed_incidents`): open, with a real coordinate, and started OR worked on within
the last 24 h. «Worked on» is a human write — a journal row or an audit event that is not one of
the observers' own — so the observers never keep an Einsatz alive by themselves. When an open
Einsatz goes quiet for 24 h its observation ends with ONE Verlauf row (``obs-end-…``), and
resumes by itself as soon as somebody writes again.
