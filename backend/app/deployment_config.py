"""The deployment-config singleton — one row, ``deployment_config`` id=1.

Everything a deployment configures about itself hangs off that single row: the config
document, the plan scales, the telemetry consent, and the station-level secrets each
admin surface mints (statistics export, Erfassungs-Poster, Einsatz-Link).

Those secret surfaces are the reason this helper exists. They write to the row *before*
anything has ever written a config document, so each of them needed the same
get-or-create — read id=1, insert an empty row when it is not there yet, flush so the
caller can assign to it. Byte-identical copies of that shape had drifted apart once on what
"empty" means; there is one now.

    """The singleton row, created empty if this deployment has none yet.

    Flushed before it is handed back, so the caller can set a column on a row that is already
    in the session's identity map. Not committed: it belongs to the caller's transaction.

    ``lock`` takes the row FOR UPDATE and re-reads it from the database, for a writer that does
    read-modify-write on ``config_json``. That is every writer of this document — there are no
    partial writes — but the HTTP ones have ``If-Match`` to refuse a lost update, and a
    BACKGROUND one has nothing: the SharePoint poll reads the layers, merges its own by id and
    writes the whole document back, so an admin saving in the Verwaltung inside that window was
    simply overwritten. ``populate_existing`` matters as much as the lock: without it the
    identity map would hand back the copy this session loaded BEFORE waiting for the lock, which
    is the stale document the lock was taken to avoid reading.

    ⚠️ The FOR UPDATE half degrades to nothing on SQLite, which has no row locking and where the
    tests run. That is sound — SQLite serialises writers at the file — but it means a test cannot
    prove the Postgres half. The re-read is dialect-agnostic and stays on either way, so what a
    test CAN prove is that a merge reads the row as it stands and preserves what it did not touch.
