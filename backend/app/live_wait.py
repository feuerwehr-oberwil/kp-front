"""Wake-ups for the long-polling live-follow reads (workspace blob + Verlauf).

Every open device follows an incident with two loops: the workspace blob
(``GET …/workspace?since=&wait=1``) and the journal (``GET …/journal?since_seq=&wait=1``).
Without this module they asked again every couple of seconds and were told «nothing new» ~99 %
of the time — the cost of a cross-device change showing up was half a poll cycle, and the cost
of a *quiet* incident was a request per device per beat, all night, on cellular.

With it a follower parks inside its GET until a writer says there is something to fetch. One
request covers the whole quiet stretch, and a change is delivered as fast as the writer's
transaction commits.

Two properties the callers depend on:

· **The wake happens after the COMMIT.** A waiter woken while the writer's transaction is still
  open would re-read the *old* state, conclude nothing changed and park again for a full
  timeout — the exact latency the long poll exists to remove. `notify_after_commit` therefore
  hands the wake-up to `transaction_hooks.after_commit`, the module that owns that boundary
  for every non-database side effect (blob cleanup, outbound notifications) — a wake-up is one
  more of those, and a rollback drops it there for the same reason it drops the others.

· **Nothing waits on a checked-out DB connection.** The endpoints query, hand the connection
  back (``await db.commit()``), and only then park here. The pool holds 10+10 connections and a
  station has more parked followers than that.

⚠️ **In-process only.** Production runs a single uvicorn worker (``backend/start.sh``: no
``--workers``), so every writer and every waiter share this registry. If this is ever deployed
across several workers or containers, a follower on worker B will not hear a write on worker A —
it degrades to its wait timeout, i.e. back to the old polling cadence, correct but slower. The
natural fix at that point is Postgres ``LISTEN/NOTIFY`` on the same database, with this module's
API unchanged.

# Every save wakes EVERY follower of the workspace — the saving device's own long poll included,
# which then downloaded the whole blob it had just sent (~38 KB gzipped on the busiest Einsatz on
# record) and threw it away, on every edit (18.10.2026). So the saves say which device wrote
# (`X-Workspace-Writer`, a random id per page load — one login is routinely open on three
# tablets, so the user cannot be the key) and the follower read says which device asks
# (`writer=`); a range of revisions that holds NOTHING but that device's own saves is answered
# without the body (api/incidents · get_workspace).
#
# ⚠️ Conservative by construction: a revision is «own» only if it is on record here with THIS
# writer. A revision bumped by any path that does not record (capture, the alarm webhook, the
# admin import), recorded on another worker, before a restart, or pruned from the window counts
# as foreign — the follower gets the body, exactly as before. Recorded after COMMIT, like the
# wake, so a rolled-back save never counts. In-process like the waiters (module docstring).
