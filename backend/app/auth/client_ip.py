"""Source identity for rate limiting — who the request actually came from.

A throttle is only as good as the key it counts against. `X-Forwarded-For` is a plain request
header: a client talking to the app directly can write whatever it likes into it, and a limiter
keyed on a value it finds there hands that client an unlimited supply of fresh buckets
(security audit SEC-08).

So trust is EXPLICIT, never inferred from the peer looking like infrastructure. The old rule
trusted any private/loopback peer's forwarded header, which means a direct client on the station
LAN could spoof arbitrary forwarded identities. Instead, `settings.trusted_forwarded_hops` names
how many reverse proxies sit in front of the app:

  · 0 (the safe default) — XFF is not consulted at all. The peer that actually opened the
    connection is the only thing the caller cannot forge, so it is the key. A deployment with no
    proxy needs no configuration to be safe; one behind a proxy that has not opted in loses
    per-client granularity (every request keys on the proxy) but is never spoofable.
  · N — each proxy *appends* the peer it saw, so the real client sits N entries from the right of
    the chain. Exactly the N rightmost entries are honoured as our own hops; anything a caller
    prepended sits to the left and is never reached. A chain shorter than promised is not the
    shape the deployment declared, so it falls back to the un-forgeable peer.

Railway/Caddy same-origin deployment: the reverse proxy is the one trusted hop → set
TRUSTED_FORWARDED_HOPS=1 (see config.py).
