    OTHER way, and two do:

      * an exception message rendered into a traceback — `httpx.HTTPStatusError` stringifies
        as «… for url '…?accesskey=<the key>'», which is how `scheduler._poll_divera`'s
        `logger.exception` wrote the station's Divera key to the container log on every failed
        poll;
      * uvicorn's access log, which writes the full query string of every request — so an
        alerting system posting to `/api/divera/webhook?secret=…` printed the station's
        webhook secret once per alarm.

    Attached to HANDLERS rather than loggers, because `uvicorn.access` sets `propagate = False`
    and never reaches the root handler.

    ⚠️ `exc_text` is pre-rendered here on purpose. `logging.Formatter.format` reuses a record's
    `exc_text` when it is already set and only falls back to formatting `exc_info` itself, so
    filling it in with a redacted rendering is what lets a FILTER — which otherwise sees only
    `msg` and `args` — reach the traceback where the leak actually lived.

    ⚠️ Belt, not braces. The braces are that no credential reaches a message in the first place
    (`divera.check_response`, `audio.transcribe`, `api/personnel._divera_unreachable`). A
    scrubber can only redact shapes it was taught — this one knows nothing about a secret that

    scripted, and unauthenticated — walked past it with a body of any size and reached request
    parsing and validation. The header check stays because refusing before reading a byte is
    strictly better, but it is now the fast path, not the guarantee.

    The guarantee is the receive wrapper: every `http.request` chunk is counted, and the first
    one that crosses the cap ends the request. Nothing further is read from the connection, and
    the exception unwinds out of whatever `await request.body()`/multipart parse asked for it,
    so the app never sees the truncated body either.

    Two caps, chosen per request: `multipart/form-data` is a file upload (media, plans,
    reference data) and gets ``max_upload_mb``; everything else gets the much smaller
    ``max_json_body_mb``. ⚠️ ``max_upload_mb`` must stay ABOVE the media route's own 100 MB
    per-file cap plus multipart overhead, or an imported voice memo dies here instead of
    getting the media route's own answer (see config · max_upload_mb).

    Settings are read per request, not captured at construction: `/admin` and the tests move
    them, and a middleware holding a stale copy would be the one place that disagreed.

    ⚠️ Installed OUTSIDE `GzipRequestMiddleware` on purpose. This bounds the WIRE size; the

    """Same-origin gate for cookie-authenticated mutations (the CSRF half of SEC-12).

    SameSite=Lax stops an unrelated site from attaching this station's cookies to a cross-site
    POST. It does NOT stop a same-site sibling — another host under the station's own domain,
    hostile or merely compromised — and for that one the browser sends them. A credentialed
    empty POST with a foreign `Origin` rotated the Erfassungs-Poster secret, invalidating every
    printed poster in the station.

    Who this applies to, and why each exemption is safe:

    * **unsafe methods only.** A GET changes nothing; gating reads would break `<img>` and the
      service worker for no gain.
    * **only when a session cookie rides along.** A caller with none has no ambient authority
      to borrow — whatever authorized it travelled in the request on purpose.
    * **no `Origin` header → through.** The admin CLI, the print agent and the alerting
      webhooks send none (nor does curl), and they carry their own explicit credential. Only a
      browser adds `Origin`, and this is the same browser/non-browser split `PUT /api/config`
      already draws to decide whether `If-Match` is mandatory.
    * **an explicit credential HEADER → through**, foreign origin and all. A cross-origin page
      cannot set `X-Capture-Token` without a CORS preflight, and this app answers none — so
      such a header means a caller that already holds the secret, and its route's own 401 is
      the honest answer rather than this one's 403.

    `Sec-Fetch-Site` is a SECOND signal, never the only one: it catches the browser request
    that arrives without `Origin`, and a client that omits both is by then indistinguishable
    from the CLI it must not break.
