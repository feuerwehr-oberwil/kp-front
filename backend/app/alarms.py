"""Alarm auto-open + auto-archive: the source-agnostic half of alarm intake.

`create_incident_from_alarm` is the one place an alarm becomes an Incident without a human
(generic `/api/alarms` intake, the Divera poller and the Einsatz-Link's rescue path all land
here); manual creation keeps its own endpoint. Auto-opened incidents are marked `auto_opened`
so the sweep can archive the untouched ones (`workspace_rev == 0`, nobody ever synced a
workspace) after `alarms.autoArchiveDays` — and the same sweep clears out incidents that WERE
worked on but never closed, on their own much longer `alarms.staleIncidentDays` clock.

An alarm opens on arrival, with no human in the loop — so «an incident exists» no longer
means «the station attended an Einsatz». That line is `Incident.editor_opened_at`: stamped on
the first authenticated *editor* workspace read/write, deliberately never for a viewer (an
Einsatz-Link responder is one). Unconfirmed incidents stay out of the stats export.
