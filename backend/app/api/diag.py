"""Diagnostics: the station's own error sink, and the bundle an operator can hand over.

The sink came first and is still the primary thing this module does — a solo operator can't
see a frontend crash that the ErrorBoundary swallows, so the browser posts uncaught errors
here and they surface in the SERVER log, on the station's own machine, where the deployer
already looks. That path needs no consent and no network: it is the app telling its own
operator what happened.

* ``POST /client-error`` — the sink. Always logged and always buffered locally
  (``telemetry/recent.py``); additionally queued for an upstream ingest only when an admin
  has switched telemetry on AND the deployer configured a DSN. Unauthenticated (a crash can
  happen on the login screen), so it is throttled per source (a token bucket, 429 past it)
  and the upstream queue is capped per hour, on top of the client's own budget. Reachable
  from every kind of Einsatz-Link session too (auth/incident_link, 24.09.2026): the 403 a
  link page got here on 23.09. is why that phone's crash never reached the log.
* ``GET /export`` — the bundle an operator downloads and attaches to a mail or a GitHub
  issue. Any logged-in user, no consent involved: it hands them their own instance's
  sanitised error traces so a Rückmeldung can say more than "es ist abgestürzt". Nothing is
  transmitted by this route — the operator is, quite literally, the transport.

There used to be a third, ``POST /report``: the Rückmeldung sheet posted the operator's text
here and the forwarder carried it upstream. It went when the maintainer's ingest did. A
queued report with no destination is worse than no route at all, because the sheet says
«gesendet» and nothing ever arrives — so the sheet now opens a mail or an issue form
directly, and the only thing this module owes it is the export above.

The contract for all of it: never 500, never trust the payload. A diagnostics sink that
becomes a source of errors is worse than no sink.
