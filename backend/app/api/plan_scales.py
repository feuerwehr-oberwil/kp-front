"""Station plan-scale calibration and georeferencing — editor-authored, persists across
incidents/devices.

A plan sheet has no inherent geo scale, so measuring on it needs a calibration factor
(`mPerU` + aspect ratio). Because a station's plans all come from the same generator with the
same layout, one calibration usually fits every plan (the `default`), with per-plan overrides
(`byPlan`) for the exceptions. This is EDITOR data (any FU can set it in the field), stored on
the deployment_config singleton in its own `plan_scales_json` column — kept out of the
admin-validated config so an admin push never wipes it.

The same document also carries the per-plan GEOREFERENCE (`georefByPlan`): the landmark
point-pairs that tie a plan sheet to the map, from which the client fits a similarity transform
and mirrors symbols in both directions (src/lib/georef.ts). It lives here because it answers the
same kind of question as the calibration — a property of the SHEET, not of an incident — and so
that a client loads and caches both in one request.

GET is public (viewers measure too, and it must be offline-cacheable at boot); PUT is editor-only.

Both answers carry a ``version`` — an opaque token of the STORED document, which the client
sends back as ``If-Match`` on its next PUT (see ``put_plan_scales``).
