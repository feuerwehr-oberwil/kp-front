    TWO doors, because they answer different questions:

    · **Übungen** — any editor, any time. An exercise is not an operational record; it exists to
      be thrown away, and needing an admin for it would make the tidy-up cost more than the
      exercise. That is the whole point of the flag, and a Wehr that cannot clear its own
      practice runs stops marking them as practice runs. A viewer still cannot (403).
      «Übung» here means CREATED as one and never marked real since
      (``exercise_since_creation``) — a real Einsatz someone marked Übung later is a real
      Einsatz for this door.

    ⚠️ The door is ``EditorOrAdmin``, not ``CurrentEditor``: the Verwaltung's own incident list
      offers this button, and /admin is reached with an ADMIN cookie that need not be
      accompanied by an editor login. Requiring both made that control fail for exactly the
      person the Verwaltung exists for.

    · **Real Einsätze** — an ADMIN session, and only once the Einsatz is ARCHIVED. Deleting one
      destroys an Einsatzakte: the Verlauf, the hash-chained audit trail, the Anwesenheit, every
      photo and voice memo. That is a legal record, so it takes the same key as the Verwaltung
      and it cannot happen to something still running — the archive step is the operator saying
      the Einsatz is over, and it is the only moment at which «löschen» is a decision rather than
      an accident. (Was a flat 403 before, which left a real Einsatz — a mistaken duplicate, a
      test alarm taken in earnest — undeletable by anybody.)

    ⚠️ The deletion is logged at WARNING before it happens, because the audit chain that would
