"""Batch E — editor-only system/maintenance status (GET /api/system).

A single read-only endpoint backing the admin "System" tab: build/version, a trivial
DB liveness probe, row counts, media-storage + disk usage, and the env-derived
integration flags (handy on the same screen).

Resilience is the contract: this endpoint must NEVER 500. Each sub-section is computed
defensively — a failing probe yields a null/error section while the rest still render.
There is no new schema class; the response is a plain dict (docs/CONFIGURATION.md is the

    The «Einrichtung» card has always computed these nine predicates client-side out of

    same answer available to anything that is not that card — a deployment check, the CLI, an
    operator asking «is this station set up» without opening a browser — and it puts the rule in
    one place, where the two copies cannot drift.

    Three things are deliberately separate in the output, because folding them loses information:

    * ``done`` is what the station's own data SAYS. Derived, never hand-set.
    * ``acknowledged`` is the hand ticks (``setup.acknowledged`` in the config document). The
      escape hatch for a row whose fact this product cannot observe — a Wehr happy with the
      built-in vehicle catalogue never writes ``fleet.vehicles``, so «Fahrzeuge» could otherwise
      never tick.
    * ``complete`` folds the two, and is the question «does this card still have anything to
      say»: false while any row is neither done nor acknowledged.

    ⚠️ Each predicate mirrors SetupChecklist.tsx exactly, including the parts that look wrong
    until you read why: ``users`` wants MORE than one (a fresh deployment always has the one
    seeded account, so «> 0» would tick on day zero), ``map`` accepts a centre in EITHER CRS
    (they are mutually exclusive, and LV95 is the Swiss default this product is built for), and
    ``geocoder`` is done on EITHER field (the locality alone already keeps the search at home).
