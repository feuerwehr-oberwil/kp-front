"""Integration credentials a station can set from a browser, encrypted at rest.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every integration this app talks to — Divera, Traccar, Web Push, speech-to-text, the two
webhook intakes, the print agent, the dead-man's-switch — used to be reachable only by
editing ``.env`` and restarting the container. ``settings = Settings()`` is built once at
boot and there is no reload path, so a browser form that wrote ``.env`` would be a lie: the
process cannot restart itself into new environment, and several scheduler jobs were
*registered or not registered* at that same moment. The values therefore have to live
somewhere the running process can re-read, which means the database.

THE SHAPE, AND WHY EACH PART OF IT
----------------------------------
* **Its own table, never ``deployment_config.config_json``.** ``GET /api/config`` is public
  (the login screen brands itself before anybody logs in) and the Sicherung export/import
  round-trip replaces that document wholesale. A credential in there would make the export a
  leak and the import a credential-deletion button. Same reasoning the three existing
  station secrets follow (``capture_secret``, ``stats_secret``, ``incident_link_key`` are
  columns, not document fields) — this is that decision, one table further along because
  there are sixteen of them and they carry their own «changed when, by whom».

* **Encrypted with a key derived from ``SECRET_KEY``, which stays in ``.env``.** A stolen
  database dump — the nightly ``pg_dump``, the pre-migration safety dump, a laptop with a
  restore on it — is useless without the environment file that was never in it. HKDF-SHA256
  with a fixed info string gives this use its own key rather than reusing the one that
  peppers PINs and signs admin sessions; AES-256-GCM is authenticated, so a tampered row
  fails loudly instead of decrypting to garbage. The credential's own name is the AAD, so a
  row copied over another row's ciphertext does not silently move a value between slots.

  ⚠️ The cost is real and is stated in the docs: rotating ``SECRET_KEY`` now makes stored
  credentials unreadable as well as every PIN. That is the same failure class the docs
  already treat as never-rotate — but it must be *legible*, so an undecryptable value is
  reported as ``unreadable`` («bitte neu setzen»), never as ``unset`` and never as a 500.

* **``.env`` still wins where it is set.** An existing deployment changes behaviour not at
  all and nothing is migrated out of its environment: if the variable carries a value, that
  value is what every consumer gets and the admin UI shows it as server-set rather than as
  an editable box. Only a station that left the variable blank can set it from a browser.

* **Write-only over the API for anything secret.** An admin session can rotate a credential
  and cannot read one back. The page shows «gesetzt · geändert am …», never the value.

READ PATH
---------
Consumers must never snapshot these at import time — that is the boot-time trap this change
exists to remove. They read through :func:`get`, which serves a process-wide snapshot that
:func:`load` refreshes from the database when it is older than :data:`CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`
(the same shape ``geocode._resolve_bias`` uses for the geocoder bias). A write refreshes it
immediately, so a credential set in the browser reaches its consumer on the next request
rather than at the next restart; a 30 s scheduler refresh covers any reader that never gets
a session of its own.
