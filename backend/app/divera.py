"""Divera 24/7 intake logic: alarm classification, alarm parsing, pool upsert.

The keyword vocabulary is not a literal here. The shipped default lives in
`data/alarm_keywords.json`, vendored byte-for-byte into kp-rueck and pinned by checksum in
both — the same mechanism as `app/telemetry/`, and for the same reason: the two products may
not share a library (`RUNNING-BOTH.md`), so the copies stay copies and a test compares them.
It used to be two hand-maintained tables that nobody compared, and they had already drifted.
A station whose alarm words differ replaces the whole vocabulary from its deployment config
(`alarmKeywords`, docs/CONFIGURATION.md §1a) — see `active_vocabulary()` below.

What stays local is what is genuinely ours: the German labels (kp-front carries `type` as a
display string, not an enum) and the matcher. kp-rueck's matcher is not identical to this one
— see the JSON's `known_matcher_divergence`.

NOTE ON THIS MODULE'S NAME. `detect_type` / `infer_priority` and the vocabulary they read are
NOT Divera-specific — the generic `POST /api/alarms` intake calls them too. They live here for
history, not for a reason; only the HTTP client below is genuinely the Divera attachment.
Moving the matcher out is a separate change, and a noisier one than it looks.

Improvement over kp-rueck: an existing pool alarm whose `ts_update` advanced gets its fields
refreshed.
