"""The Traccar → vehicle_samples capture job (scheduler._vehicle_samples_sweep).

`GET /incidents/{id}/samples`, its schema and the client-side replay all shipped long ago and
read an empty table: nothing ever wrote a row (the endpoint's own docstring said so —
"PLAN-audit-trail §4, Phase 6"). So the Verlauf could replay drawings and journal rows but not
where the vehicles went, which is the one part of a replay nobody can reconstruct from memory.

What this file pins is the sampling RULE, because that is the part with a judgement in it: a
track dense enough to redraw the route, without a row per truck per tick for a fleet that
spent six hours parked at the Magazin.
