"""Async DB test harness for the integration tests.

Runs against ``DATABASE_URL`` when set (CI provides a postgres:16 service), otherwise an
ephemeral in-memory SQLite (``sqlite+aiosqlite``). The postgres-specific column types
(JSONB, the postgres UUID) are taught to render on SQLite via lightweight ``@compiles``
shims so the *whole* schema — incidents, audit chain, revoked_tokens — stands up locally
without a database server. Every timestamp column in the schema declares
``DateTime(timezone=True)``; SQLite's own DATETIME impl silently drops the tzinfo on write
and hands back a naive datetime on read, which is not what asyncpg does, so that impl is
swapped for one that reattaches UTC on the way out. SQLite also ignores every foreign key
unless ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` is set per connection, so it is — an ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` /
``RESTRICT`` behaves here the way Postgres enforces it. Behaviour the tests assert
(optimistic-lock UPDATE, blocklist PK lookup, hash chain, FK cascades) is then
dialect-agnostic, so SQLite is a faithful stand-in here.

⚠️ One thing it is NOT: every session shares ONE connection (``StaticPool`` — an in-memory
database lives and dies with its connection), so sessions are not isolated transactions the
way they are on Postgres. A session that rolls back undoes whatever another session has
written but not yet committed. Only concurrency exposes that (a background task writing while
a request runs); such a test lets the task finish first (see ``test_stt._poll_done``).

On Postgres the schema is built ONCE per process and every test ends by emptying it (rows
deleted, serial counters restarted) — not by dropping and re-creating 41 tables, which was most
of the suite's 15 CI minutes. A test still starts on empty tables, exactly as before; one that
drops a table on purpose (``test_integration_credentials``) makes the next test rebuild it.

Under pytest-xdist (``-n 4``) each worker gets its OWN database, ``<name>_gw0`` … next to the
one ``DATABASE_URL`` names, created at session start and dropped at the end. Workers sharing
one database would be the end of a reliable suite. ``DATABASE_URL`` itself is pointed at the
worker's database before any app module reads it, so code on the app's own engine lands there
too. A plain ``uv run pytest`` (no ``-n``) uses ``DATABASE_URL`` as it is.

Fixtures:
- ``engine`` / ``db_session``: a rolled-back async session per test.
- ``client``: an httpx AsyncClient wired to the FastAPI app with ``get_db`` overridden
  and the token blocklist pointed at the test session factory.
- ``editor`` / ``viewer``: seeded users with a known PIN.
