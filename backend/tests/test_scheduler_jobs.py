"""The unattended scheduler jobs: what a tick writes, what it refuses to do, what it swallows.

Every job in ``app/scheduler.py`` runs on a timer with nobody watching, so its failure mode is
silence — a sweep that stops sweeping, a credential that never reaches its consumer, a leader
that lost its lock and kept its jobs. What this file pins is therefore three things:

* the **gate** — a job whose credential is missing must do nothing at all, and must start
  working on the tick after that credential appears (the whole reason these jobs are
  registered unconditionally instead of at boot);
* the **write** — each sweep's effect measured in a SECOND session, because the part of these
  jobs that is theirs alone is the ``await db.commit()``: a sweep that deletes and does not
  commit is indistinguishable from one that works, until the next restart;
* the **swallow** — a collaborator that raises must leave the transaction clean and say so in
  the log, never wedge the scheduler.

``_vehicle_samples_sweep`` has its own file (``test_vehicle_samples.py``); the advisory-lock
primitives are shared with ``test_scheduler_leadership.py``, which covers the two happy paths.
