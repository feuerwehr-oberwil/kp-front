"""Browser origin boundaries: the same-origin gate on cookie mutations (SEC-12) and the
app-wide security-header layer (hardening item 1).

SameSite=Lax already stops an unrelated website from attaching this station's cookies to a
cross-site POST. What it does not stop is a *same-site sibling* — another host under the
station's own registrable domain, hostile or merely compromised — for which the browser
happily sends them. A credentialed empty POST with a foreign `Origin` rotated the capture
poster secret in the audit, which is the whole of this file's subject.

The rule, and why it is drawn where it is:

- it applies to unsafe methods only (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) and only when the request
  actually carries one of this app's session cookies — a caller with no cookie has nothing
  to be ridden;
- **no `Origin` header → allowed.** The admin CLI, the print agent, the alerting webhooks and
  every `curl` send none, and they carry their own explicit credential. This is the same
  browser/non-browser split `PUT /api/config` already draws on `Sec-Fetch-Site`/`Origin`;
- an explicit credential HEADER (capture token, webhook secret, …) exempts the request, even
  with a foreign origin: a cross-origin page cannot set a custom header without a preflight,
  and this app answers no preflight;
- `Sec-Fetch-Site` is a second signal, never the only one.
